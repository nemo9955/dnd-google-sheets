When the brain is worn directly on top of a humanoid's head, that humanoid becomes immune to the detect sentience ability of intellect devourers. Instead, an intellect devourer that detects that humanoid will assume that humanoid is a host of a living intellect devourer and will treat them accordingly.

While frightened in this way, a creature drops anything they are carrying and must use their full movement as well as any potential dash actions to run as far away from the protective enchantment as possible. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if they are within the protective enchantment. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to this effect for the next 24 hours.

            "Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement) Crafted by: Aboleth Brain x1 (Artificer) This pale turquoise amulet seems to have a faint flicker of something moving in it, like seeing a creature in murky waters. While wearing this amulet, you gain telepathy out to a range of 120 ft., can understand and speak Deep Speech, and become proficient in Intelligence (History) checks if you weren\u2019t proficient already.You may also spend an action to target one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. That target must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be magically charmed by you. This charm persists until either you or the target dies, or if you are on different planes of existence. You and the charmed target may communicate with each other telepathically over any distance so long as you are wearing and attuned to this item. You may only have up to 3 targets charmed in this way at a time. If you successfully charm another target while you already have 3 targets charmed, the charm effect ends on the creature that you charmed first. Whenever the charmed target takes damage, they may repeat the saving throw. On a success, the effect ends.

            "Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement) Crafted by: Medusa Head x1 (Blacksmith) This full helmet is magically fused with the head of a medusa to recreate its petrifying gaze. While wearing this helmet, you may spend your action to open or close the visor; closing the visor causes the medusas visage to be complete and activates this item\u2019s ability. While this item\u2019s ability is active, any creature within 30 feet of you that you can see and who can see you, must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is instantly petrified. Otherwise, a creature that fails the save begins to turn to stone and is restrained. The restrained creature must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming petrified on a failure or ending the effect on a success. The petrification lasts until the creature is freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic. The medusa\u2019s visage only possesses enough magic to allow its petrifying gaze ability to function for 1 minute. Anytime this item is used, subtract the amount of time it is used from this minute. Once this time has been expended, this item loses its magical property. This item regains all expended time upon the next dawn."
