aarakocra	Aarakocra	5	Aarakocra Feathers (small pouch)	8sp	2 lb.			0.8	2	1		The large feathers of an aarakocra are enjoyed among some of the more ostentatious members of society as fun accessories and fashion highlights. If you can find a tailor willing to take them, you are sure to be able to earn at least a few silver for a good amount of them. 
aarakocra	Aarakocra	10	Aarakocra Heart	2gp	5lb.			2	5	1		Aarakocra have an innate connection to the elemental planes that allows them to summon air elementals when enough of them gather together. Burning their hearts in an offering can achieve much of the same effect but with less control over the temperment of the summoned elemental. Use: When 5 different creatures within 30 feet of each other hold 5 different aarakocra hearts and spend their actions on three consecutive turns to burn the hearts, they may summon an air elemental in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of them. The burners must remain still while burning the hearts. This elemental is hostile to all creatures it can see around it, but any of the 5 creatures that summoned it can spend their action to try and succeed on a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check to direct the air elemental's hostility at a creature they can both see within 60 feet. The air elemental remains for 1 hour.
aboleth	Aboleth	10	Aboleth Teeth (large bag)	20 gp	15 lb.			20	15	1		The razor sharp teeth that line the stinking maw of the aboleth are each as large as a human's forearm and twice as thick. While too unwieldy and crooked to turn into a weapon, more exotic merchants would pay a tidy sum to turn them into decorations and trinkets.
aboleth	Aboleth	15	Aboleth Mucus	20 gp	1 lb.	Potion of Water Breathing (DMG)	vial	20	1	3	 (3 vials)	Aboleths demand service and obsequience, even going so far as to warp the creatures around themselves to suit their domain. While the transformative mucus that surrounds the aboleth tends to dissipate quickly after their death, swift harvesters can bottle some of it for use in alchemy projects later.
aboleth	Aboleth	20	Aboleth Eye	375 gp	45 lb.	Lens of Forgotten History		375	45	1		Larger than a normal creature's head. Removed from its skull and ever unblinking, it still seems to see more than most mortals ever will.
aboleth	Aboleth	25	Aboleth Brain Lobe	1,600 gp	30 lb.	Aboleth Amulet		1600	30	1		The power of the aboleth lies not in its many tentacles, but in its brain. Even now and then, when you hold it long enough, you swear you can hear whispers of forgotten history in the corner of your mind.
deva	Deva	10	Deva Blood	450 gp	1 lb.		vial	450	1	3	 (3 vials)	The blood of an angel flows with radiant energy that brings life to all it touches (it clearly didn't work hard enough for its original owner though). Many of the most desperate people actively seek angels in an attempt to harvest their blood as a panacea, without putting much thought into the worse fate that awaits them should they succeed. Use: When you drink this blood, you regain 4d8+2 hit points and are freed from any curse (except the curse of the fallen), disease, poison, blindness, and deafness.
deva	Deva	15	Deva Wing	700 gp	20 lb.	Wings of Flying (DMG)		700	20	2	 (x2)	There is perhaps nothing more distinctive than the sillhouette of glorious white angel wings against a radiant light. As some of the most powerful magical wings in all the planes, these make for almost perfect base materials for the ever-useful wings of flying.
deva	Deva	20	Deva Skin	750 gp	25 lb.	Angel Robe		750	25	1		The alabaster white skin of a deva gleams in the morning sun, and a single glance of its beatuty has been known to turn sinners from their paths of evil. If you are not one of those people however, you may take this skin and use it to simulate some of the miraculous abilities inherent in these angels.
planetar	Planetar	5	Planetar Ear	200 gp	2 lb.			200	2	2	 (x2)	A planetar is known for its ability to hear lies whenever they are spoken. Their ears carry on this trait even in death and can be seen twitching when falsehood passes through them. Use: While holding two of these ears, you have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) ability checks to detect a lie being spoken.
planetar	Planetar	10	Planetar Blood	600 gp	1 lb.		vial	600	1	3	 (3 vials)	The blood of an angel flows with radiant energy that brings life to all it touches (it clearly didn't work hard enough for its original owner though). Many of the most desperate people actively seek angels in an attempt to harvest their blood as a panacea, without putting much thought into the worse fate that awaits them should they succeed. Use: When you drink this blood, you regain 6d8+3 hit points and are freed from any curse (except the curse of the fallen), disease, poison, blindness, and deafness.
planetar	Planetar	15	Planetar Wing	700 gp	30 lb.	Wings of Flying (DMG)		700	30	2	 (x2)	There is perhaps nothing more distinctive than the sillhouette of glorious white angel wings against a radiant light. As some of the most powerful magical wings in all the planes, these make for almost perfect base materials for the ever-useful wings of flying.
planetar	Planetar	25	Planetar Bone	7,500 gp	6 lb.	Divine Justice		7500	6	1		The celestial bones of a planetar are stronger than steel and carry a charge of radiant energy within them long after their owner's demise. While most radiantly infused weapons are designed to force evil creatures to scurry away, weapons forged from the ever-vigilant planetars are designed to keep evil creatures nearby, ensuring they meet their divine judgement.
solar	Solar	5	Solar Ear	200 gp	2 lb.			200	2	2	 (x2)	A solar is known for its ability to hear lies whenever they are spoken. Their ears carry on this trait even in death and can be seen twitching when falsehood passes through them. Use: While holding 2 of these ears, you have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) ability checks to detect a lie being spoken.
solar	Solar	10	Solar Blood	800 gp	1 lb.		vial	800	1	3	 (3 vials)	The blood of an angel flows with radiant energy that brings life to all it touches (it clearly didn't work hard enough for its original owner though). Many of the most desperate people actively seek angels in an attempt to harvest their blood as a panacea, without putting much thought into the worse fate that awaits them should they succeed. Use: When you drink this blood, you regain 8d8+4 hit points and are freed from any curse (except the curse of the fallen), disease, poison, blindness, and deafness.
solar	Solar	15	Solar Wing	700 gp	30 lb.	Wings of Flying (DMG)		700	30	2	 (x2)	There is perhaps nothing more distinctive than the sillhouette of glorious white angel wings against a radiant light. As some of the most powerful magical wings in all the planes, these make for almost perfect base materials for the ever-useful wings of flying.
solar	Solar	25	Solar Eye	11,000 gp	2 lb.	Celestial Helm		11000	2	2	 (x2)	The burning gaze of a solar is capable of reducing even the strongest of evildoers to a smoking mass of flesh on the ground. Taking these eyes and performing extraordinarily powerful magic on them can transform them into diamonds that shine the same way they did under the solar's control.
animated-armour	Animated Armour	10	Animating Rune	5 sp	1 lb.			0.5	1	1		The basis of any animated object is the magical rune etched into its surface that enchants it and brings it to life. While these runes cannot be transferred from one object to another, resourceful tinkerers are capable of salvaging some of the expensive powders and ashes used to make them, and thus they can be sold for a small bit of profit.
flying-sword	Flying Sword	10	Animating Rune	5 sp	1 lb.			0.5	1	1		The basis of any animated object is the magical rune etched into its surface that enchants it and brings it to life. While these runes cannot be transferred from one object to another, resourceful tinkerers are capable of salvaging some of the expensive powders and ashes used to make them, and thus they can be sold for a small bit of profit.
rug-of-smothering	Rug of Smothering	10	Animating Rune	5 sp	1 lb.			0.5	1	1		The basis of any animated object is the magical rune etched into its surface that enchants it and brings it to life. While these runes cannot be transferred from one object to another, resourceful tinkerers are capable of salvaging some of the expensive powders and ashes used to make them, and thus they can be sold for a small bit of profit.
rug-of-smothering	Rug of Smothering	15	Shimmer Cloth	10 gp	7 lb.	Cloak of Mending (XGE) or Cloak of Billowing (XGE) 		10	7	1		The fibers of an enchanted rug continue to carry on a special property to them even after being rendered inanimate. When looked upon, these fibers seem to glimmer and move ever so slightly without any outside force acting on them. This property has been noted by tailors that incorporate them into various vanity items like the amusing cloak of mending or cloak of billowing.
ankheg	Ankheg	5	Ankheg Chitin	1 gp	30 lb.			1	30	1		Extremely hard, but too unwieldy and unconfortable to use in making armour. The ankheg's hide still finds some uses as a building material, especially for subterranean dwelllers who appreciate its suitability to rocky environments.
ankheg	Ankheg	10	Ankheg Gaster	2 gp	9 lb.	Canteen of Last Resort		2	9	1		A series of bladders in the hindquarters of an ankheg, this organ is analagous to the intestines of a humanoid. Although ankhegs are known for eating flesh, they absorb the majority of their nutrients from the soil they burrow through. Artificers are able to take this fact and create a handy survival tool for explorers with a strong stomach.
ankheg	Ankheg	15	Ankheg Bile	4 gp	1 lb.		vial	4	1	2	 (2 vials)	Ankhegs are well known for their incredibly potent digestive fluids that dissolve their prey. As such, alchemists find ankheg bile to be a particularly useful ingredient when creating their own acidic concoctions. Use: As an action you may make a ranged weapon attack to throw this vial at a target within 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against the target, treating the vial as an improvised object. On a hit, the target suffers 1d6 acid damage.
azer	Azer	10	Azer Ash	1 sp	1 lb.			0.1	1	1		Residual material from the azer's corpse. This ash still maintains a faint trace of the magic that created it. While not overly useful, some artisans like to sprinkle it over their creations for good luck.
azer	Azer	15	Azer Bronze Skin	10 gp	50 lb.			10	50	1		Azers need no armour, as their skin is already made of durable, mastercrafted bronze. While the trauma of its owner's demise has made the skin difficult to repurpose directly for armour, it is still high quality material, and any blacksmith worth their salt would be happy to get it.
azer	Azer	20	Spark of Creation	12 gp	1 lb.	Bronze Companion	enchanted vial	12	1	1		Although the azer of this particular flame of creation is dead, a single smouldering spark remains, and those with knowledge of the arcane are able to quickly harvest and store it safely for later use. While small, these sparks have immense potential and are often used in either the construction of living trinkets, or the lighting of magical forges. Requires enchanted vial.
banshee	Banshee	15	Banshee Echo	13 gp	1 lb.		spirit paper	13	1	1		The incorporeal banshee leaves very little behind except the last whispers of its terrible wail. With some spirit paper, a good harvester can collect the echo of this wail before it vanishes forever and use it in times of desperation. Requires spirit paper. Use: You may spend an action to tear this item open and release the banshee wail kept within. All creatures within 30 feet of you that can hear must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature drops to 0 hit points. On a success, a creature takes 3d6 psychic damage. This wail has no effect on constructs and undead.
banshee	Banshee	20	Banshee Remnant	60 gp	1 lb.	Pipes of Haunting (DMG)	spirit paper	60	1	1		It takes a particularly nimble mind and fast action to trap enough remnants of a banshee to make a usable crafting item. If successful however, they are often refashioned into enchanted reeds that create a haunting noise when used in wind instruments. Requires spirit paper. 
basilisk	Basilisk	5	Basilisk Tooth (small pouch)	2 gp	2 lb.			2	2	1		As the basilisk feeds on stone, its teeth are infamous for being extraordinarily hard and sharp. Stonemasons across the land value these teeth as tools in theit craft.
basilisk	Basilisk	10	Basilisk Eye	2 gp	1 lb.	Basilisk Gaze Poison		2	1	2	 (x2)	The petrifying gaze of the basilisk is known far and wide. As such, the eyes of a basilisk are prized for their inherent magical properties and their use in the creation of petrifying tonics. It is said that more nefarious wizards make use of these eyes to create trapped statues that transform unwary intruders into stone.
basilisk	Basilisk	15	Basilisk Bile	6 gp	1 lb.	Basilisk Gaze Poison	vial	6	1	2	 (2 vials)	It is a common misconception that basilisks digest stone. In fact, the fluids inside the basilisk's gullet transform consumed stone back into organic matter to be consumed. This bile is thus worth a good amount to alchemists seeking to make an oil to counter the effects of a basilisk's gaze.
behir	Behir	10	Behir Scales (large bag)	55 gp	25 lb.			55	25	1		The scales of a behir resemble a dragon's but are different in many ways in the eyes of a trained observer. While these scales are often found decorating items in an unscrupulous tailor's shop marketed as actual dragon scales, the fact that they are much smoother and more flexible than an actual dragon's makes them much more useful for fashion.
behir	Behir	15	Behir Horn	300 gp	30 lb.			300	30	1		The horn of a behir is composed of a unique keratin that has an odd reaction to the presence of dragons. A dragon's mere presence causes these horns to resonate, usually alerting a behir to the presence of their hated foe. The horns will still function in the hands of anyone else, but the dragon usually must be much closer for the vibrations to be detected. Use: When within 1 mile of a dragon (whether it in its true form or polymorphed into a different shape), this horn will begin to vibrate, with the vibrations becoming more pronounced the closer it is to the dragon. This horn does not indicate the direction of the dragon, only its general proximity.
behir	Behir	20	Lightning Sack	875 gp	10 lb.	Lightning Oil or Storm Caller		875	10	1		This large, but surprisingly light leathery sack is located at the back of the behir's cavernous mouth, and is roughly the size of a picnic basket. Inside is a mixture of chemicals, fluids and enzymes that when exposed to the open air, erupts in a destructive crackle of lightning. While extremely dangerous, alchemists and weaponsmiths alike will crawl over themselves to obtain some of this powerful energy. Use: The lightning sack can be thrown by itself up to a range of 20 feet. If thrown, the lightning sack will explode on impact, dealing 4d10 lightning damage to all creatures in a 10 foot radius, or half that on a successful DC 14 Dexterity saving throw.
beholder	Beholder	15	Beholder Membrum	45 gp	40 lb.			45	40	1		The anatomy of a beholder is infinitely alien and strange to any scholar native to the Material Plane. One of the most curious features of the beholder is that aside from its brain, the beholder features a noticeable dearth of internal organs. Instead, any internal space not occupied by brain matter is filled with a large rubbery balloon that seems to act as the beholder's heart, lungs, and stomach. How it achieves all of these simultaneous functions is unknown. This organ is as versatile as its owner, and many scholars are eager to obtain a complete sample for their research into transmutation. 
beholder	Beholder	20	Beholder Eye Stalk	650 gp	9 lb.	Eye Stalk Wand		650	9	1		While the eye stalks of the beholder may be severed from its body, they still retain some of the magical energy that allowed them to fire powerful rays at their enemies. Skilled artificers can take these stalks and use them as the cores of magical wands that emit the same types of rays they emitted in life. Alternatively, four of the intact stalks may be used as part of a ritual to summon a spectator. If a player harvests an eye stalk, roll 1d10. The type of eye stalk they receive corresponds to the number rolled, as described in the beholder statblock.
beholder	Beholder	25	Beholder Main Eye	3,250 gp	30 lb.	Anti-Magic Crystal		3250	30	1		The main eye of the beholder is unique in that instead of issuing forth a beam of magical energy, it instead does the opposite: emitting a cone of nullification that disrupts the Weave and prevents the functioning of any magic it gazes at. While it is inactive due to being severed from a living beholder, learned wizards know how to transfigure this organ into an anti-magic crystal, the type that can be used to protect their own strongholds against magical incursions.
death-tyrant	Death Tyrant	15	Death Tyrant Jaw	700 gp	20 lb.	Greataxe, +2 (DMG)		700	20	1		The teeth of a beholder must never be underestimated, even in death. Their jaws possess a wicked bite, and when attached to the handle of an axe, so can your backswing.
death-tyrant	Death Tyrant	25	Death Tyrant Eye	3,500 gp	20 lb.	Negative Energy Crystal		3500	20	1		The eye of a beholder undergoes a terrible transformation when it transitions into undeath, emitting a cone of negative energy rather than anti-magic. But like a normal beholder eye, this eye can be transformed into a crystal of great power that many powerful wizards enjoy employing in their lairs.
spectator	Spectator	15	Spectator Eye Stalk	14 gp	7 lb.	Lesser Eye Stalk Wand		14	7	1		The stalks of the spectator are less powerful than those of the beholder it consumed to be summoned. However, their potential to be made into wands by artificers are the same. When crafted properly, they continue to contain an arcane charge that allows them to discharge the same types of magical rays they did in life. If a player harvests an eye stalk, roll 1d4. The type of eye stalk they receive corresponds to the number rolled, as described in the spectator statblock.
spectator	Spectator	20	Spectator Main Eye	60 gp	20 lb.	Shield of Reflection		60	20	1		The main eye of the spectator functions differently to that of the beholder. While the beholder's emits an anti-magic cone at all times, the spectator's can be used to reflect poorly casted spells at other targets. When used for crafting, the magic of the eye can be transferred over to a shield, to grant it the same ability.
needle-blight	Needle Blight	5	Needles (small bundle)	5 cp	2 lb.			0.05	2	1		The signature needles of the needle blight. While not more particularly useful than any other needle you would find on the forest floor, some fletchers find they make reliable sturdy material for wooden darts. 
needle-blight	Needle Blight	10	Blight Pollen (small pouch)	3 sp	1 lb.	Potion of Speak With Plants		0.3	1	1		Most blights are incapable of speech as we understand it. Instead, they communicate with each other through the use of pollen that can be carried for miles. Alchemists and druids however have figured out how to repurpose this pollen for potions that allow the user to communicate with regular plant life.
needle-blight	Needle Blight	15	Blight Seeds	1 sp	1 lb.	Blight Oil		0.1	1	5	 (x5)	The rapid ability of the blights to spread their influence is well known to any forest dweller. They do this through the many seeds that each blight carries within them. These dry, wrinkled seeds sprout in a matter of hours and grow to maturity in days, forming the infamous vines, brambles, and weeds of a blight infestation. While most of their dark properties are lost if not planted by an actual blight, some alchemists are capable of repurposing them for a crop fertiliser or an oil that reacts strangely with plantlife.
needle-blight	Needle Blight	20	Gulthias Sap	6 sp	1 lb.		vial	0.6	1	1	 (vial)	The bodies of blights exhibit a strange property. When large quantities are mulched and then strained for some time, a few drops of a sticky, dark red sap sometimes drips out which more daring druids use in their rituals.
twig-blight	Twig Blight	15	Blight Seeds	1 sp	1 lb.	Blight Oil		0.1	1	5	 (x5)	The rapid ability of the blights to spread their influence is well known to any forest dweller. They do this through the many seeds that each blight carries within them. These dry, wrinkled seeds sprout in a matter of hours and grow to maturity in days, forming the infamous vines, brambles, and weeds of a blight infestation. While most of their dark properties are lost if not planted by an actual blight, some alchemists are capable of repurposing them for a crop fertiliser or an oil that reacts strangely with plantlife.
twig-blight	Twig Blight	20	Gulthias Sap	6 sp	1 lb.		vial	0.6	1	1	 (vial)	The bodies of blights exhibit a strange property. When large quantities are mulched and then strained for some time, a few drops of a sticky, dark red sap sometimes drips out which more daring druids use in their rituals.
vine-blight	Vine Blight	5	Vines (small bundle)	5 cp	5 lb.			0.05	5	1		The signature vines of the vine blight. These have been made sturdier yet more flexible in order to constitute the blight's body. When stripped down to their fibers, they make good material for rope and ties.
vine-blight	Vine Blight	10	Blight Pollen (small pouch)	3 sp	1 lb.	Potion of Speak With Plants		0.3	1	1		Unlike the needle blight which uses its pollen to communicate with other needle blights, the vine blight's pollen is capable of interacting directly with other plants, turning entire forests into dark defenders of the blight's domain. Despite that, their usage in alchemy is the same.
vine-blight	Vine Blight	15	Blight Seeds	1 sp	1 lb.	Blight Oil		0.1	1	5	 (x5)	The rapid ability of the blights to spread their influence is well known to any forest dweller. They do this through the many seeds that each blight carries within them. These dry, wrinkled seeds sprout in a matter of hours and grow to maturity in days, forming the infamous vines, brambles, and weeds of a blight infestation. While most of their dark properties are lost if not planted by an actual blight, some alchemists are capable of repurposing them for a crop fertiliser or an oil that reacts strangely with plantlife.
vine-blight	Vine Blight	20	Gulthias Sap	6 sp	1 lb.		vial	0.6	1	1	 (vial)	The bodies of blights exhibit a strange property. When large quantities are mulched and then strained for some time, a few drops of a sticky, dark red sap sometimes drips out which more daring druids use in their rituals.
bugbear	Bugbear	10	Bugbear Hide	8 sp	13 lb.			0.8	13	1		Despite usually being filthy and riddled with mange, an intact bugbear hide can actually serve as very good leather. It is not uncommon for more nomadic people to wear these tanned hides for both comfort and as a sign of their strength.
bugbear-chief	Bugbear Chief	10	Bugbear Hide	8 sp	13 lb.			0.8	13	1		Despite usually being filthy and riddled with mange, an intact bugbear hide can actually serve as very good leather. It is not uncommon for more nomadic people to wear these tanned hides for both comfort and as a sign of their strength.
bugbear-chief	Bugbear Chief	15	Heart of Hruggek	1 gp	6 lb.			1	6	1		The most fearsome of bugbears carry with them the blessing of their god Hruggek which allows them to surge past any danger and debilitations. If you are willing to indulge in your own inner savage, you too can take this blessing by consuming the bugbear's heart, but beware of any side effects. Use: You may spend an action to consume this heart. If you do so, you have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, frightened, paralyzed, poisoned, stunned, or put to sleep for the next hour. Once this effect wears off, you must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of exhaustion as the adrenalinne filled organ passes through your system.
bulette	Bulette	10	Bulette Teeth (small pouch)	11 gp	2 lb.	Dagger, +1 (DMG) or Spear, +1 (DMG)		11	2	1		Capable of puncturing even steel armour, bulette teeth are well regarded as materials for crafting daggers and spears. Some cultures even consider bulette hunting to be a rite of passage, using the weapon made from their kill for the rest of their adult lives.
bulette	Bulette	15	Bulette Claw	8 gp	10 lb.	Stone Cleaver Weapon		8	10	4	 (x4)	Capable of powerful digging, the bullette claw makes for a wonderful weapon base, one that is capable of piercing rock and metals alike. 
bulette	Bulette	20	Bulette Hide	60 gp	50 lb.	Stone Swim Armour		60	50	1		While the bulette relies on its powerful jaws and claws to tunnel through solid rock, it is aided by a layer of rock dissolving slime that it exudes constantly from its hide. When harvested quickly, the hide itself retains this property and can be crafted into protective equipment for subterranean adventurers.
bullywug	Bullywug	5	Bullywug Tongue	8 cp	3 lb.			0.08	3	1		A bullywug tongue is remarkably long for their size and incredibly tough. Swamp folk can often be found drying these and using them as rope substitutes.
cambion	Cambion	5	Cambion Sulfur (small pouch)	7 gp	2 lb.			7	2	1		Unlike most fiends, a cambion does not dissolve when it is slain. Its bizarre physiology however does still react strangely on death with parts of its body spontaneously combusting as it dies. These reactions are not enough to destroy the body, but it does create small piles of sulfur that are quite useful in various demonology related projects.
cambion	Cambion	10	Devil-Tinged Blood	4 gp	1 lb.	Philter of Love (DMG)	vial	4	1	3	 (3 vials)	As the child of a fiend and a human, the blood of a cambion possesses certain magical properties that are even more powerful due to their compatibility with humanoid physiology.
cambion	Cambion	15	Cambion Wing	30 gp	20 lb.	Infernal Wings		30	20	2	 (x2)	As with many fiends, the wings of a cambion are useful in creating the famous item: infernal wings. When taken whole, they can serve as a majority of the base, forming bat wings when the final item is put to use.
carrion-crawler	Carrion Crawler	10	Carrion Crawler Guts	5 sp	10 lb.			0.5	10	1		As their name implies, carrion crawlers feast solely on putrid and rotting flesh. As disgusting as their digestive system may seem, it is uniquely adapted to overcoming any diseases or poisoning that would befall any other creature attempting such a diet. Local healers have thus developed numerous uses for a carrion crawler's guts, ranging from a salve to treat gangrene, to a tonic for treating indigestion.
carrion-crawler	Carrion Crawler	15	Carrion Crawler Mucus	10 gp	1 lb.		vial	10	1	1	 (vial)	The mucus of a carrion crawler is remarkably poisonous, especially since it only requires contact with the skin to take effect. Use: A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. The poisoned creature is paralyzed. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A vial of this poison may be applied to coat 1 melee weapon or up to 10 pieces of ammunition. These remain coated for 10 minutes after which the poison degrades too much to be useful. 
centaur	Centaur	10	Centaur Hoof	5 sp	13 lb.			0.5	13	4	 (x4)	The hooves of a centaur are much harder than those of a mundane horse, and centaurs in their pragmatism have even been found harvesting them for their own use. It is not uncommon for centaurs to be in the possession of tools, bowls, and even weapons made from the hooves of their dead tribal members.
centaur	Centaur	15	Centaur Tail	3 gp	4 lb.	Shortbow, +1 (DMG) or Longbow, +1 (DMG)		3	4	1		The hairs of a centaur are renowned for their tensile strength while remaining supple and flexible. As such they make superb bowstrings and centaur archers are known for using their own hairs in their bows.
chimera	Chimera	10	Chimera Goat Hoof	2 gp	6 lb.			2	6	2	 (x2)	The hindquarters of the monstrous chimera. While they resemble an ordinary goat in shape, they are noticebly larger in size. While not usable for much, they do make for fine trophies.
chimera	Chimera	15	Chimera Goat Head	25 gp	20 lb.	Chimera Trident		25	20	1		One of the chimera's three heads. Larger than a regular goat's, the horns are particularly hard and large. Many mountain folk consider an ale mug made from a chimera's horns to be a very enticing gift.
chimera	Chimera	15	Chimera Lion Paw	4 gp	6 lb.			4	6	2	 (x2)	The leonine front paws of the chimera. Larger than a normal lion's, with claws twice as sharp. Some druids prefer using these as their focus when performing transmutation magic, believing that it makes their spellwork easier. Whether that is true or not has yet to be confirmed.
chimera	Chimera	20	Chimera Lion Head	40 gp	25 lb.	Chimera Trident		40	25	1		One of the chimera's three heads. Larger than a regular lion's, this head makes a fantastic trophy when stuffed and mounted, particularly when placed in the quarters of a skittish house guest.
chimera	Chimera	20	Chimera Dragon Wing	25 gp	30 lb.	Chimera Kite		25	30	2	 (x2)	The draconic wings of the chimera. While they lack the same amount of magical power as a genuine dragon's wings, they are also much easier to handle and much easier to get a hold of. Daring tinkers have taken to using them in making kites strong enough to lift smaller races high into the air.
chimera	Chimera	25	Chimera Dragon Head	150 gp	25 lb.	Chimera Trident		150	25	1		One of the chimera's three heads. While the flame is less powerful than a genuine dragon's, the glands that produce the flame is much easier to access in a chimera's head, and provide materials that are much more stable to work with. Alchemists prize these glands as a source of highly flammable oil.
chuul	Chuul	10	Chuul Pincer	3 gp	40 lb.			3	40	2	 (x2)	The oversized pincer of a monstrous chuul. While too unwieldy to be fashioned into a useful weapon, the razor sharp hooks can be repurposed for useful tools, including, but not limited to, instruments of torture.
chuul	Chuul	15	Chuul Venom	10 gp	1 lb.	Chuul's Caress Poison	vial	10	1	1	 (vial)	A rather nasty toxin, wringed from the tentacle appendages of the chuul. Unfortunately, the death of its owner causes it to lose much of its potency but can still be used as a base by knowledgable alchemists to create another paralysing potion.
chuul	Chuul	20	Arcana Ganglia	100 gp	5 lb.	Magical Dowsing Rod		100	5	1		At the base of a chuul's brain lies a peculiar bundle of nerves referred to as the arcana ganglia. This highly sensitive lobe vibrates in the presence of magic and is what grants chuul's their innate ability to sense magic around them. Designed by their aboleth masters through generations of magic and breeding, there are only a handful of artificers in the world capable of repurposing it into a functioning tool capable of replicating the chuul's natural ability.
cloaker	Cloaker	10	Cloaker Tooth (small pouch)	5 gp	2 lb.			5	2	1		Resembling the needle-like teeth of a moray eel but stronger, the teeth of the cloaker can be used to make a variety of tools. Some of the more notorious thieves in the world even boast possessing lockpick sets made entirely of cloaker teeth.
cloaker	Cloaker	15	Cloaker Tail	85 gp	20 lb.	Whip +1 (DMG)		85	20	1		The infamous cloaker tail, covered in dozens of razor sharp spines. Drow taskmasters have developed a technique of taking the tails, treating them with special oils, and reusing them as whips.
cloaker	Cloaker	20	Cloaker Hide	500 gp	25 lb.	Cloak of Displacement (DMG)		500	25	1		Even for the most experienced of tanners, the skin of the cloaker is exceptionally difficult to remove. Due to the cloaker's unique physiology, a single misplaced cut can cause the creature's internal enzymes to spill and stain the hide. If done correctly however, the skin will maintain its shadowy and illusive appearance and may be used as the foundation for the ever useful cloak of displacement.
cockatrice	Cockatrice	10	Cockatrice Bile	2 sp	1 lb.		vial	0.2	1	1	 (vial)	Unlike basilisks, a cockatrice cannot consume stone. Unfortunately, anything that receives so much as a graze from its beak becomes petrified, and with the cockatrice's frenzied hunting style, such an occurrence is more then common. As such, its bile has certain properties that slow down the petrification process, allowing the cockatrice to get some nourishment before its food becomes undigestible. This bile has become a staple of a stonemason's toolkit as it allows them to temporarily soften stone for easier handling.
cockatrice	Cockatrice	15	Cockatrice Droppings (small pouch)	5 sp	1 lb.			0.5	1	1		Cockatrices are infamous for their enthusiasm in devouring a meal, and as such, they occasionally end up swallowing food that they have already accidentally petrified. The food remains stone through the cockatrice's digestive system, and some consider the resulting food statues to be a novelty to say the least. There are even some enterprising individuals who keep cockatrice farms in order to harvest their droppings for stone trinkets (I assume they do not reveal to their customers where they came from however).
cockatrice	Cockatrice	20	Cockatrice Beak	1 gp	1 lb.	Petrifying Dagger		1	1	1		The infamous beak of a cockatrice, capable of turning any living creature into petrified stone. Despite common belief, the petrifying magic has nothing to do with the cockatrice's saliva, but is entirely within the cockatrice's beak alone. Any artificer worth their salt knows the techniques to turn an undamaged beak into a weapon that shares the cockatrice's petrifying ability.
couatl	Couatl	15	Couatl Venom	40 gp	1 lb.		vial	40	1	1	 (vial)	The venom of a couatl is entirely non-lethal, reflective of the couatl's pacifist nature. Couatl are in fact known for occasionally secreting this venom for the mortals they partner with in the hopes of averting deaths wherever possible. Use: Can be used to coat up to 10 pieces of slashing or piercing ammunition or one slashing or piercing melee weapon. Applying the poison takes 1 minute. For the next 10 minutes, any creature successfully hit must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, or become poisoned for 24 hours. Until this poison ends, the target is unconscious. A creature automatically wakes up if they receive damage or if an adjacent creature spends their action to wake them up.
couatl	Couatl	20	Couatl Feather (large bag)	120 gp	5 lb.	Pillow of Perfect Rest		120	5	1		The feathers of a couatl are extraordinarily vibrant, yet as soft as down. A particular pillow has been made with these feathers that shares the couatl's ability to shield its mind from external psychic threats. Powerful people have been known to use these pillows to shield their sleeping moments from intrusion, as well as to just get an extremely comfortable sleep. 
crawling-claw	Crawling Claw	10	Cursed Knucklebones	1 sp	2 lb.	Charlatan's Die (XGE)		0.1	2	1		"The bones of a hand that has been transformed by necromantic manipulation are notable for still carrying trace elements of those same energies. They are not useful for much, but it is said that a set of dice carved from these knucklebones roll lower than is statistically likely, giving rise to the ubiquitous unlucky gambler term: ""the dead man's hand."""
cyclops	Cyclops	10	Cyclops Eyelid	10 gp	4 lb.	Deceptive Eyepatch		10	4	1		The enormous lid of a cyclops is made of a strange material, quite different to the rest of the cyclops' skin. The purpose of this is still a mystery, but various crafters have managed to take its esoteric properties and use it for their own entertaining projects.
cyclops	Cyclops	15	Cyclops Heart	25 gp	25 lb.			25	25	1		The extremely large heart of a cyclops. Makes a good trophy when preserved and mounted on a base.
cyclops	Cyclops	20	Cyclops Eye	140 gp	20 lb.	Monocle of Focus		140	20	1		Once they are roused to interest, cyclopses are known to relentlessly pursue whatever it is they set their eye on. Experiments on cyclops remains have revealed that the eye itself is partly to blame, as its unique situation forces the cyclops to focus on one thing for prolonged periods of time. Artificers have taken this property and applied it into a battle aid that doubles as a stylish dinner party accessory.
darkmantle	Darkmantle	10	Darkmantle Sucker (small pouch)	5 sp	1 lb.			0.5	1	1		Anybody who has been attacked by a darkmantle can attest to the suction power of its tentacles. Reliable even beyond the death of its owner, many Underdark residents have adapted these suckers to be used for medical tools and other implements.
darkmantle	Darkmantle	15	Darkmantle Otolith	2 gp	1 lb.	Earhorn of Hearing (XGE)		2	1	1		A bony structure on the inside of a darkmantle's head that acts as its ear. Skilled artificers can use this to create a variety of audio enhancing magical items.
death-knight	Death Knight	15	Blighted Ash (small pouch)	800 gp	3 lb.			800	3	1		When the flesh of a defeated death knight is burned in a ritual fire, the resulting ashes retain the same dark aura of its original form. If one has the resolve for it, these ashes can be mixed with oils and special powders then applied to the body to gain certain protections from the undead. Use: You may mix these ashes with 20 gold pieces worth of rare oils and powdered gems to create a paste that grants certain defences against undead when rubbed into the body. For 24 hours after using it on yourself, undead creatures have disadvantage on any Wisdom (Perception) checks made to find you. In addition, you gain resistance to any necrotic damage dealt from an undead source and advantage on any saving throw imposed by an undead creature.
death-knight	Death Knight	20	Cursed Blood	500 gp	1 lb.	Potion of Desecration	vial	500	1	3	 (3 vials)	Blood is a generous term to apply to the coagulated muck that cloys in a death knight's veins. Blacker than the cursed warrior's soul, this substance makes for a versatile reagent in certain desecration rituals and blood curses. Use with caution.
death-knight	Death Knight	25	Death Knight Heart	4,000 gp	6 lb.	Black Heart		4000	6	1		Even though a death knight may fall in battle, its dark curse will eventually form a new body somewhere and force its soul to continue its mockery of life. If one takes its heart and preserves it in a secret ritual, the death knight's new body will be formed without the organ. From then on, the missing heart can be used as a method of tracking the death knight, beating whenever it senses its old master nearby.
demilich	Demilich	15	Bone Dust (small pouch)	800 gp	2 lb.			800	2	1		The disintegrated remains of a demilich's body. Everytime you look away, it seems to move slightly. Can be used as a spell component for powerful and dark necromantic magics.
demilich	Demilich	20	Demilich Smoke	3,000 gp	1 lb.	Demilich Censer	enchancted vial	3000	1	1	 (vial)	Rather than a corporeal body, most of the demilich's shape consists of a choking vapour that smells like forgotton tombs. This smoke contains an almost insignificantly small fraction of the demilich's true essence, but if bottled and stored properly, can be turned into an item to track the demilich wherever it may reappear. Requires enchancted vial.
demilich	Demilich	25	Soul Gem (Acererak disciple Demilich only)	16,000 gp	12 lb.	Turned Soul Gem		16000	12	1		The demilich disciples of Acererak practice a particularly notorious necromantic magic: inserting soul gems into their empty eye sockets to steal the spirits of their victims. While taking the gem away from a defeated demilich is simply a matter of picking it up, turning it over to your own control is considerably harder and requires a complicated ritual soon after the demilich's defeat. A successful result grants the bearer a powerful, but dark magical artifact.
balor	Balor	15	Balor Ash (3 small pouches)	500 gp	3 lb.	Demon Bomb		500	3	1		The ashes of a balor after it has self destructed. Smelling strongly of brimstone, this ash may be used as either a component for summoning lesser demons, or when creating particularly explosive bombs.
barlgura	Barlgura	10	Barlgura Fang	4 gp	3 lb			4	3	2	 (x2)	The large fang of a barlgura is a little too unwieldy to use as an actual weapon. They do however make fantastic ceremonial daggers and are often used in dark magic rituals.
barlgura	Barlgura	15	Barlgura Hand	20 gp	33 lb.	Any melee bludgeoning weapon, +1 (DMG)		20	33	2	 (x2)	The enormous hands of a barlgura are capable of breaking a man in two with a single blow. The tough knucklebones make wonderful weapon components.
barlgura	Barlgura	20	Barlgura Bile	60 gp	1 lb.	Potion of Rage	vial	60	1	2	 (2 vials)	The rage of a barlgura is legendary even among the seething masses of demonkind. Such is their rage that their bile literally rises with their anger which in turn becomes a fantastic potion base for those seeking to emulate the ferocity of this demon.
chasme	Chasme	10	Chasme Leg	5 gp	20 lb.			5	20	2	 (x2)	A chasme's leg is capable of supporting its massive weight when walking on any surface, even upside down. Intrepid adventurers have been known to repurpose these legs as pitons which stick to surfaces rather than stab into them. Use: You gain advantage on any Strength (Athletics) check made to climb walls so long as you use these legs when doing so.
chasme	Chasme	15	Chasme Proboscis	40 gp	10 lb.	Demon Needle		40	10	1		The proboscis of a chasme has a dark ubiquity among those that hunt demon cults. Too often have they been found on tables of twisted instruments of torture, used to extract blood from kidnapped victims before their inevitable sacrifice. It is truly a horrid feeling to have one's life sucked away by a chasme proboscis, and I would not wish it on my worst enemy. 
chasme	Chasme	20	Chasme Wing	55 gp	8 lb.	Drone producer		55	8	2	 (x2)	The diaphonous wings of a chasme are perhaps their most dangerous appendage. When vibrated at high speeds they create an unbearable buzzing not unlike a monstrous cloud of flies. Ambitious tinkers have studied the physiology of a chasme and figured out how to emulate their musculature in a machine capable of making the same droning noise.
dretch	Dretch	15	Fetid Miasma	8 gp	1 lb.		vial	8	1	1	 (vial)	If a dretch is useful for one thing it is to make a literal big stink. When masses of these demons gather, the resulting effluent can be more dangerous than even a rampaging balor. Use: As an action you may make a ranged weapon attack to throw this vial at a point within 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Any creature within 10 feet of that point must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of its next turn. While poisoned in this way, the target can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both, and can't take reactions.
glabrezu	Glabrezu	10	Glabrezu Horn	25 gp	27 lb.	Horn of the Fiendish Voice		25	27	2	 (x2)	The goat-like horn of a glabrezu. Does not contain much magical power in and of itself, but some demonologists do enjoy grinding it up for their rituals, or speak through it to lend credence to their voice.
glabrezu	Glabrezu	15	Glabrezu Pincer	150 gp	33 lb.			150	33	1		Resembling the claws of a giant crab, the glabrezu's pincers have a grip that can restrain even the strongest of creatures. Due to the glabrezu's natural fire resistance, resourceful blacksmiths repurpose these pincers as forging tools when working with magical flames.
glabrezu	Glabrezu	20	Glabrezu Skin	625 gp	40 lb.	Demon Leather		625	40	1		The skin of a glabrezu is particularly tough and resistant to damage. If removed and treated properly, the resulting leather makes for a similarly tough set of leather armour (with a fierce aesthetic as a bonus).
goristro	Goristro	10	Goristro Fur (large pouch)	200 gp	10 lb.			200	10	1		The fur of a goristro resembles that of a wild bull and seems to constantly emanate a faint heat. More ostentatious warlocks tend to spin their winter cloaks from this material, but whether or not it has any magical utility is still up for debate.
goristro	Goristro	15	Goristro Blood	100 gp	1 lb.	Potion of the Siege	vial	100	1	7	 (7 vials)	The blood of the goristro constantly bubbles, even long after it is removed from its source. When prepared into a potion, it can grant the drinker the strength of the demon it came from, but the side effects may not be worth it.
goristro	Goristro	20	Goristro Hoof	3,000 gp	32 lb.	Warhammer +3 (DMG)		3000	32	2	 (x2)	A goristro's hoof is made of the same material as its infamous horns and thus are just as hard. Wielding a hammer forged from these hooves is a surefire way to strike fear into the hearts of your enemies.
goristro	Goristro	25	Goristro Horn	9,600 gp	40 lb.	Siege Dust		9600	40	2	 (x2)	Castle architects and siege masters have an old joke, that if armies ever learned how to train goristros, they'd both be out of a job. Indeed, the horn of the goristro is stronger than castle stone walls and a single one of these demons are capable of ending a siege by themselves. It takes a master craftsman to properly grind these horns down, but the resulting dust can be used to reinforce a weapon to make it as strong as the demon it was harvested from.
hezrou	Hezrou	5	Hezrou Teeth (small bundle)	10 gp	12 lb.			10	12	1		The spiny, shark-like teeth of the hezrou. Menacing when attached to an implement of torture, but their irregular formation makes them useful for little else.
hezrou	Hezrou	10	Hezrou Blood	15 gp	1 lb.	Potion of Pollution Breathing	vial	15	1	5	 (5 vials)	The blood of the hezrou is as thick and sludgy as week old garbage, and smells just as bad. If you have the stomach for it however, injesting it with a few neutralising herbs temporarily innoculates the body to foul miasmas and effluents.
hezrou	Hezrou	15	Hezrou Stink Gland	65 gp	8 lb.			65	8	1		The rank stench of the hezrou lingers in one's memory long after they have already been removed from its presence. Removing this gland without rupturing it takes an extrordinarily steady hand, but once harvested, can be thrown as a quick and dirty bomb. Use: As an action you may throw this item at a point within 20 feet, causing it to explode on impact. Any creature within 10 feet of that point must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of its next turn.
hezrou	Hezrou	20	Hezrou Claw	170 gp	25 lb.	Any melee piercing weapon, +2 (DMG)		170	25	2	 (x2)	The enormous claw of the hezrou. Incredibly sharp, and never seems to dull. Can be forged into a powerful and intimidating weapon.
manes	Manes	5	Manes Vapour	5 gp	1 lb.	Potion of Sickness	vial	5	1	1	 (vial)	The vapour from a defeated manes is a noxious substance that cloys in the throat and leaves the eyes watering. Thankfully, exposure to it is not overly dangerous, and can in fact be used to temporarily boost one's immune system in exchange for relatively mild symptoms.
marilith	Marilith	10	Marilith Blood	100 gp	1 lb.	Potion of Reflexes	vial	100	1	5	 (5 vials)	Mariliths are renowned for the supernatural reflexes and inhuman co-ordination that allows them to fight with six arms seamlessly. By placing their blood in a crucible, an experienced alchemist can extract the adrenaline from a maralith's blood and mix it into a potion that allows a mortal to temporarily emulate the agility of this fearsome demon.
marilith	Marilith	15	Marilith Snake Leather	1,400 gp	30 lb.	Studded Leather Armour, +2 (DMG)		1400	30	1		While it resembles an ordinary snake, the skin of the marilith's reptilian tail is harder and tougher than most plate armour. It is a rare craftsman that possesses the skills to properly work this leather, but finding one is worth it for the almost impenetrable armour you will receive. 
marilith	Marilith	20	Marilith Spine	5,000 gp	30 lb.	Cape of Helping Hands		5000	30	1		"While their top halves may superficially resemble a humans with a few additional limbs, the internal physiology of a marilith differs dramatically. Most noticeably in their spines which have been adapted to support the numerous extra limbs and lower appendage of this demon. This spine may serve as the frame of an audacious magical cape that grants an extra ""helping hand"" in battle."
nalfeshnee	Nalfeshnee	5	Nalfeshnee Teeth (small pouch)	30 gp	4 lb.	Glutton Cutlery		30	4	1		While they may be yellow and stained from centuries of poor hygiene, the teeth of a nalfeshnee are still made of a high quality ivory that surpasses those found in mortals. They may be made into a variety of things, but the nalfeshnee's glutton nature lends them well to being made into cutlery.
nalfeshnee	Nalfeshnee	10	Nalfeshnee Tusk	150 gp	18 lb.	Any piercing weapon, +2 (DMG)		150	18	2	 (x2)	Heavy and thick, much like the nalfeshnee itself. Make a weapon from these tusks and you can gore your enemies with all the strength of the Abyss.
nalfeshnee	Nalfeshnee	15	Nalfeshnee Wing	350 gp	15 lb.			350	15	2	 (x2)	The almost comically small wings of a nalfeshnee do not function on actual physics to support its large weight, but rather sophisticated space displacement magic that belies the nalfeshnee's brutish appearance. These wings are also responsible for the nalfeshnee's ability to teleport, something that can be taken advantage of by a skilled harvester. Use: You may spend an action focusing on a wing in your hand. If you do so, you magically teleport, along with any equipment you are wearing or carrying, up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. Once this item has been used once, it loses all magical properties and becomes useless.
nalfeshnee	Nalfeshnee	20	Nalfeshnee Eyes	800 gp	2 lb.	Demon Light		800	2	2	 (x2)	Nalfeshnees are full of surprises that hide behind their otherwise savage looking appearance. The most dangerous of these are their eyes which are capable of producing a horrifyingly captivating light that destroys the wills of any unlucky enough to see it. With good artificing, these eyes can be transformed into gems to give off a similar performance.
quasit	Quasit	5	Quasit Venom	1 gp	1 lb.	Potion of Poison (DMG)	vial	1	1	1	 (vial)	Quasit venom is more of an annoyance than a serious threat, but the paralysis side effect can certainly ruin someone's day. When mixed with other ingredients however, this venom can serve as one of many potential bases for a potion of poison.
quasit	Quasit	10	Quasit Blood	10 gp	1 lb.		vial	10	1	1	 (vial)	Quasit blood is as thin and slippery as the demon it came from, but serves as an excellent spell component for lower-tier magic. Use: The next time you cast the find familiar spell, you may consume a vial of quasit blood instead of using the usual material component of the spell. If you do, your summoned familiar gains the magic resistance trait described in the quasit's statblock. Your familiar also shares this trait with you so long as you are within 10 feet of it. Both of these effects last for 1 hour, or until your familiar next disappears or is dismissed.
shadow-demon	Shadow Demon	20	Demonic Imprint	160 gp	1 lb.	Shadow Amulet	spirit paper	160	1	1		As the shadow demon lacks a substantial form, there is nothing to harvest from it except its spiritual essence. However, if one manages to capture this essence using spirit paper, they will essentially hold complete dominion over said demon. At this point, the spirit paper has a myriad of uses, but the most popular among demonologists is to transfer the essence to a demon amulet. This gives the owner the ability to resummon the demon in their proper physical form, while still maintaining complete control over them. Requires spirit paper.
vrock	Vrock	5	Vrock Feathers (small bundle)	10 gp	2 lb.			10	2	1		Black as the night and twice as scary. While they make for a macabre flourish to one's outfit at a costume party, they aren't useful for much else.
vrock	Vrock	10	Vrock Talon	16 gp	10 lb.	Dagger +1 (DMG)		16	10	2	 (x2)	The talons of a vrock are incredibly sharp, easily capable of rending through armour like a scythe through dry grass. When fashioned into a set of daggers, they can make one a cut above the rest in a fight.
vrock	Vrock	15	Vrock Vocal Cords	40 gp	2 lb.	Demon Music Box		40	2	1		The terrifying screech of a vrock is capable of stunning creatures with its piercing volume. While a removed vrock's vocal cords are unable to create the same effect, a good tinker can use them for a slightly different diabolical purpose.
vrock	Vrock	20	Vrock Spores	50 gp	1 lb.		vial	50	1	1	 (vial)	The collected spores of a vrock, requiring a special collection process and preservation in oil to ensure they retain their potency even after the original owner's death. Use: Can be used to coat up to 5 pieces of slashing or piercing ammunition or one slashing or piercing weapon. Applying the spores takes 1 minute. For the next 10 minutes, the coated item is considered magical and any creature successfully hit by this weapon must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned. While poisoned in this way, a target takes 1d10 poison damage at the start of each of its turns. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Emptying a vial of holy water on the target also ends the effect on it.
yochlol	Yochlol	15	Demon Pearl	300 gp	4 lb.			300	4	1		Yochlol's do not so much eat as they do engulf their prey. While the yochlol's digestive enzymes are capable of dissolving just about anything given enough time, there are occasionally a few items that gather inside the yochlol that do not break down and instead stay inside its slime body. Like an oyster, the yochlol forms layers around these undigestible materials, creating pearl-like substances. Unfortunately these pearls share the same sickly yellow colour as the yochlol, making them more novelties than anything else.
yochlol	Yochlol	20	Yochlol Ooze	750 gp	1 lb.		vial	750	1	1	 (vial)	The ooze of a yochlol is said to be more poisonous than that of the deadliest spiders in the world. It is ironic then that the other societies of the Underdark use this poison against the drow after they have defeated their demonic servants. Use: Can be used to coat up to 5 pieces of slashing or piercing ammunition or one slashing or piercing weapon. Applying the poison takes 1 minute. For the next minute, any creature successfully hit must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 6d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half that on a successful saving throw.
barbed-devil	Barbed Devil	10	Barbed Devil Barb	1 gp	10 lb.	Arrow+1 (DMG), Bolt +1 (DMG)		1	10	10	 (x10)	Touching a barbed devil is like sleeping in a bed of porcupines. Incredibly sharp and durable, these barbs sometimes find a second use as nails in the crafting of particular sets of armour and equipment. Otherwise they serve as building material for sturdy arrows and bolts.
barbed-devil	Barbed Devil	15	Barbed Hide	30 gp	10 lb.	Barbed Cloak		30	10	1		Barbed devils fight with a frenzy unmatched by many mortal creatures. As such, by the time you finish hunting them, their carcass is so damaged that their hide becomes effectively useless. If you manage to skin one properly however, the hide can be treated, tanned, and turned into a cloak that is perfect for deterring anyone who thinks that hugging is an acceptable form of greeting.
barbed-devil	Barbed Devil	20	Barbed Devil Blood	14 gp	1 lb.	Potion of Fire Resistance (DMG)	vial	14	1	3	 (3 vials)	Despite their name, barbed devils harbour just as much proclivity for employing fire magic as they do their barbs. The fire is literally in their blood, and with proper alchemy, it can be in yours too.
barbed-devil	Barbed Devil	25	Barbed Devil Tail	150 gp	15 lb.	Whip +1 (DMG)		150	15	1		The barbed devil's tail is even deadlier than its razor sharp claws, and when swung at full force is said to crumple plate armour and pierce the flesh beneath. Thankfully, there is nothing stopping anyone else from taking this tail, crafting it into a whip, and using it for their own purposes. 
bearded-devil	Bearded Devil	10	Bearded Devil Blood	2 gp	1 lb.	Potion of Bravery	vial	2	1	3	 (3 vials)	A bearded devil fights with a ferocity unmatched by any mortal. Even in the rare occurances in which a bearded devil unit finds itself outnumbered, they continue to fight, never once breaking rank. If one takes their blood, distills it and mixes it into a draught, they too can share in the infamous bravery of these fiendish warriors.
bearded-devil	Bearded Devil	15	Clump of Beard Lashes	20 gp	3 lb.	Flail +1 (DMG)		20	3	1		A disgrace to beards and bearded creatures around the multiverse. The lashes that extrude from the bearded devil's chin are tougher than oiled cords and covered with dozens of wicked barbs. Any weaponsmith worth their forge can craft these lashes into a particularly powerful flail.
bearded-devil	Bearded Devil	20	Beard Poison	40 gp	1 lb.		vial	40	1	1	 (vial)	Difficult to extricate from the diminuitive glands hidden in the bearded devil's chin, this poison maintains its potency and is often used by assassins targetting magically talented individuals. Use: Can be used to coat up to 5 pieces of slashing or piercing ammunition or one slashing or piercing weapon. Applying the poison takes 1 minute. For the next minute, any creature successfully hit must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, or be poisoned for 1 minute. While poisoned in this way, the target can't regain hit points. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
bone-devil	Bone Devil	10	Bone Devil Bone (large bag)	20 gp	40 lb.			20	40	1		The bones of the bone devil are considerably durable and feel more like steel than bone. They can be refashioned into a suite of fire-resistant tools, but due to their origin, not many are willing to use them. 
bone-devil	Bone Devil	15	Bone Devil Skin	150 gp	10 lb.	Devil Vellum		150	10	1		Despite their appearance, a bone devil actually does possess skin; a dessicated sheet that is stretched tight over its bones. While those properties are undesirable in a skin, they make for a perfect sheet of vellum. Indeed, the infamous skin-bound abyssal tomes found in dark libraries are often made using bone devil skin.
bone-devil	Bone Devil	20	Bone Devil Tail	500 gp	40 lb.	Stinger Whip		500	40	1		The stinger of the bone devil's tail is sharp enough to pierce through even the toughest of armour and deliver a potent dose of debilitating venom. With a few modifications, this tail can be adapted into a whip to store and deliver any kind of poison the wielder wishes.
bone-devil	Bone Devil	20	Devil Wings	250 gp	20 lb.	Infernal Wings		250	20	2	 (x2)	The diaphonous but extraordinarily strong wings of the bone devil. Despite their relatively fragile appearance, they are strong enough to hold the considerably heavy bone devil aloft and allow it to fly at high speeds.
chain-devil	Chain Devil	15	Living Chain	150 gp	20 lb.	Iron Bands of Bilarro (DMG) or Chain of Entanglement 		150	20	1		The chains of this devil's namesake occupy a unique space between animate and inanimate. They are bewitched by similar magic to the notorious animated objects that are often found in an abandoned wizard's tower, and thus make excellent material for the crafting of magical items.
chain-devil	Chain Devil	20	Chain Devil Eye	200 gp	1 lb.	Mask of Fear		200	1	2	 (x2)	The gaze of the chain devil is renowned for its unnerving countenance. Those who stare at it for too long swear that they see the faces of those they'd rather forget. With some enchantments and a bit of craftsmanship, the eyes can be inserted into a mask that can strike the same fear into the wearer's enemies.
erinyes	Erinyes	10	Fiendish Poison	220 gp	1 lb.		vial	220	1	1	 (vial)	Although the erinyes is a master warrior whose swordplay is matched by few mortals, they are not above poisoning their weapons to further tip the scales in their favour. Use: Can coat up to 10 pieces of ammunition or 1 melee weapon for 1 hour. Applying the poison takes 1 minute. Any creature successfully hit must succeed a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or suffer 3d8 poison damage and be poisoned. The poison lasts until it is removed by the lesser restoration spell or similar magic.
erinyes	Erinyes	15	Erinyes Heart	400 gp	6 lb.			400	6	1		"It is said that the first erinyeses were fallen angels, corrupted by exposure to the fiendish energies of the Abyss. Whether or not that is true, the heart of an erinyes certainly possesses some degree of corrupting influence itself and can be used as a magical reagent when crafting a cursed weapon. Use: Upon successful creation of a weapon or piece of armour that requires attunement to use, the crafter may use the erinyes heart to perform a ritual that curses the newly made piece of equipment. If they do so, the crafted equipmet carries a random curse from the ""fiendish curses"" table. Performing this ritual destroys the erinyes heart."
erinyes	Erinyes	20	Devil Wings	450 gp	25 lb.	Infernal Wings		450	25	2	 (x2)	The great wings of the erinyes that resemble those of a fiery eagle in flight. Inherently magical and easily repurposed into a pair of infernal wings.
horned-devil	Horned Devil	10	Horned Devil Horn	25 gp	30 lb.	Horn of the Fiendish Voice		25	30	2	 (x2)	The eponymous horns of the horned devil resemble those of an oversized goat. Extremely hard, they make striking trophies when mounted on one's mantle or displayed in a sacrilegious ritual; whichever is more appealing to you.
horned-devil	Horned Devil	15	Horned Devil Blood	45 gp	1 lb.	Potion of Sloth	vial	45	1	5	 (5 vials)	Horned devils are noticebly lazy and sluggish, especially for a creature as motivated as a devil. When their blood is mixed with other soporifics, it creates a tonic that can weaken the motivation of even the most stalwart creature.
horned-devil	Horned Devil	20	Horned Devil Tail	625 gp	15 lb.	Wound Biter Weapon		625	15	1		The tail of the horned devil ends in a vicious barb designed to open wounds and cause a victim to die a slow, painful death. If removed from the horned devil however, the tail can be repurposed into a vicious pike, spear, or whip.
horned-devil	Horned Devil	20	Devil Wings	400 gp	25 lb.	Infernal Wings		400	25	2	 (x2)	As the horned devil serves as the flying soldier for the armies of the Abyss, their wings are particularly strong and make good crafting material.
ice-devil	Ice Devil	15	Ice Devil Blood	80 gp	1 lb.	Potion of Winterbite	vial	80	1	5	 (5 vials)	Ice devils bleed a blue substance that resembles dirty slush. If one melts this blood down and then rethickens it with certain powders, the resulting potion is capable of making the drinker impervious to even the most fierce winter.
ice-devil	Ice Devil	20	Ice Devil Mandible	550 gp	8 lb.	Frostbite Weapon		550	8	2	 (x2)	It is said that being pierced by the mandibles of an ice devil feels like being impaled upon an icicle. As such, it seemed obvious that weaponsmiths would scramble to attach them to sticks and hilts to make weapons that harness the power of pure winter.
ice-devil	Ice Devil	25	Ice Devil Carapace	5,000 gp	80 lb.	Frostbite Armour		5000	80	1		The chitinous shell of the ice devil is colder and harder than an ancient buried ice sheet, and requires patience and a sharp ice pick to harvest in tact. Using a specialised forge, a very skilled blacksmith can reshape this carapace into a suit of armour that can protect the wearer from any form of extreme temperature.
imp	Imp	5	Imp Venom	1 gp	1 lb.		vial	1	1	1	 (vial)	The stinger of an imp can be surprisingly dangerous if one receives a full dose of the venom within. Use: Can coat up to 5 pieces of ammunition or 1 melee weapon for 10 minutes. Applying the poison takes 1 minute. Any creature successfully hit must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, taking 3d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
imp	Imp	10	Imp Blood	10 gp	1 lb.		vial	10	1	1	 (vial)	Imp blood is as thin and slippery as the devil it came from, but serves as an excellent spell component for lower-tier magic. Use: The next time you cast the find familiar spell, you may consume a vial of imp blood instead of the usual material component of the spell. If you do, your summoned familiar gains the magic resistance trait described in the imp familiar's statblock. Your familiar also shares this trait with you so long as you are within 10 feet of it. Both of these effects last for 1 hour, or until your familiar next disappears or is dismissed.
imp	Imp	15	Imp Head	5 gp	2 lb.	Fiend Censer		5	2	1		"Imps are well known for their constant drone, incessantly gibbering promises of power and corruption to their so called ""masters."" In death however, their tendency to spy and spill secrets can be put to better use. An imp's severed head, along with some choice necromantic rituals and artificing can create a magical censer that alerts its owner to the presence of fiends in the vicinity."
lemure	Lemure	10	Lemure Essence	5 sp	1 lb.			0.5	1	1		The blobbish, fetid body of the lemure is useful for little in both life and in death. Their essence on the other hand is much more useful, as it serves as the currency of the Nine Hells (due to price fluctuations, the value of an individual lemure soul may differ depending on the time of reading). As the lemure technically belongs to the devil who corrupted its original soul in the first place, do beware when harvesting these as there may be a devil who is less than pleased about being robbed.
pit-fiend	Pit Fiend	10	Pit Fiend Blood	160 gp	1 lb.	Potion of Infernal Vitality	vial	160	1	5	 (5 vials)	A pit fiend's blood hisses, boils, and bubbles long after it has been removed from its body, as if the fiend's wrath at its enemies continues even after its death. Cooling this blood and seperating out the plasma can create a potion that grants the drinker the same unholy vitality of its original owner.
pit-fiend	Pit Fiend	10	Pit Fiend Venom	300 gp	1 lb.		vial	300	1	3	 (3 vials)	A pit fiend's venom is one of the most insidious of all the fiends. Besides the horrible pain they inflict on their victim, its corrupting influence even blocks out magical assistance, keeping wounds open and bleeding even in the face of divine help. Use: Can be used to up to 15 pieces of slashing or piercing ammunition or 1 slashing or piercing weapon for 1 hour. Applying takes 1 minute. Any creature successfully hit must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned. While poisoned in this way, the target can't regain hit points, and it takes 6d6 poison damage at the start of each of its turns. The poisoned target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. 
pit-fiend	Pit Fiend	15	Pit Fiend Claw	1,600 gp	20 lb.	Halberd, +3 (DMG)		1600	20	2	 (x2)	For many hapless adventurers, a pit fiend's claw is the last thing they ever see. If reforged into a weapon however, it may be the last thing your enemies ever see.
pit-fiend	Pit Fiend	20	Devil Wing	2,000 gp	30 lb.	Infernal Wings		2000	30	2	 (x2)	The mighty wings of the pit fiend are among the finest of all the devils. Massive canvases capable of cloaking even the pit fiend's massive frame, they make for the ideal material to craft a pair of infernal wings.
pit-fiend	Pit Fiend	25	Pit Fiend Head	18,000 gp	35 lb.	Helm of Abyssal Domination		18000	35	1		A pit fiend is one of the most terrifying beings in the entire multiverse. As such, it stands to reason that anybody that is wearing the severed head of a pit fiend as a helmet should be considered even more terrifying. Indeed, if one can detach this fiend's head from its body, haul it back to an artificer for reforging, and then wear it proudly despite knowing the retribution that they may face from those that pit fiend considered its ally; that person rightfully deserves to be feared by the lessers around them.
spined-devil	Spined Devil	10	Spine Devil Blood	2 gp	1 lb.	Fiend Fuel	vial	2	1	1	 (vial)	The blood of the spine devil smells faintly of lantern oil and is responsible for the devil's fiery properties. Since the flammable enzymes are diluted in its blood, careful distillation needs to be performed before they can be repurposed into bombs and equipment.
spined-devil	Spined Devil	15	Spined Devil Spine (any the spine devil has remaining) 	1 gp	1 lb.	Fire Arrow or Fire Bolt		1	1	1		The spine devil's eponymous spines carry within them a magical charge that causes them to combust upon impact with their target. Removal thus must be done in a steady and methodical way so as to prevent accidental activation. Once harvested safely however, they may be refletched into arrowheads to make a particularly insidious arrowhead.
allosaurus	Allosaurus	15	Allosaurus Jaw	4 gp	20 lb.	Greataxe, +1 (DMG)		4	20	1		The jaw of the mighty allosaurus, able to bite cleanly through bone and ligament. While it may look crude, this jawbone can be crafted into a greataxe capable of literally biting through an opponent's armour.
allosaurus	Allosaurus	15	Allosaurus Claw	4 gp	10 lb.	Dagger, +1 (DMG)		4	10	1		The claws of the mighty allosaurus, able to rend the skin and flesh of its hapless victim. Excavations of sites have found many examples of ancient cultures that made daggers from these claws, which are still in a surprisingly good condition.
ankylosaurus	Ankylosaurus	10	Ankylosaurus Hide	5 gp	50 lb.	Studded Leather Armour (DMG)		5	50	1		The ankylosaurus is covered with numerous plates that protect it from damage. While difficult, it can be reformed into a set of leather armour that boasts the same protection it did for its last owner.
ankylosaurus	Ankylosaurus	15	Ankylosaurus Tail	12 gp	35 lb.	Any melee bludgeoning weapon, +1 (DMG)		12	35	1		The tail of the ankylosaurus can crush all of a man's bones with a single swing. Knobbed and reinforced, it makes a fine natural weapon.
ankylosaurus	Ankylosaurus	20	Ankylosaurus Skull	48 gp	60 lb.	Dino-Helm		48	60	1		Sturdy and with thick plates to reinforce it, the skull of the ankylosaurus in many ways resembles nature's first attempt at a battle helmet. Bringing this to a blacksmith of some skill can let them show nature a few pointers.
plesiosaurus	Plesiosaurus	15	Plesiosaurus Tooth	1 gp	3 lb.	Arrow, +1 (DMG)		1	3	10	 (x10)	The jaw of the plesiosaurus is lined with dozens of needle-like teeth. Their particular shape lends itself well to making powerful arrow-heads, and many primitive cultures have been discovered with quivers full of them.
pteranodon	Pteranodon	10	Pteranodon Wing	6 sp	17 lb.			0.6	17	2	 (x2)	The wing of the pteranodon resembles an organic canvas stretched over skeletal bone. The canvas itself is quite useful for the creation of small sails and similar equipment, and merchants will pay a decent amount for an intact sample.
pteranodon	Pteranodon	15	Pteranodon Beak	1 gp	7 lb.	Lance (DMG)		1	7	1		The pteranodon's beak in many ways resembles a lance formed of keratin. Evidently, many primitive cultures agree, and seeing a tribe armed with pteranodon lances is not uncommon.
triceratops	Triceratops	15	Triceratops Skull	80 gp	120 lb.	Tri-Horn Shield		80	120	1		The triceratops' distinctive skull featuring a protective bony frill and three horns. If one can survive the beast's charge long enough to harvest this skull, they can craft a shield that allows the wielder to boast the same abilities.
tyrannosaurus-rex	Tyrannosaurus Rex	15	Tyrannosaurus Rex Claw	200 gp	70 lb.	Glaive, +2 (DMG)		200	70	1		Despite their relative diminuitive size, the claw of the T-Rex is as strong and deadly as the rest of it. With a bit of reinforcement, the claw can be forged into a glaive capable of rending even the toughest of armours.
tyrannosaurus-rex	Tyrannosaurus Rex	15	Tyrannosaurus Rex Jawbone	200 gp	100 lb.	Greataxe, +2 (DMG)		200	100	1		The jawbone of the T-Rex, capable of devouring even other dinosaurs. A mighty prize for felling a mighty foe, it can be recrafted into a powerful greataxe.
displacer-beast	Displacer Beast	10	Displacer Beast Tentacle	10 gp	18 lb.	Whip, +1 (DMG)		10	18	2	 (x2)	The prehensile tentacles of a displacer beast, tipped with spiked pads. While it takes the displacer beast's unique musculature to whip them with sufficient strength, they can still serve as strong whips in the hands of anyone else.
displacer-beast	Displacer Beast	15	Displacer Beast Blood	12 gp	1 lb.	Obfuscation Pigments	vial	12	1	5	 (5 vials)	When the black, glittering blood of the displacer beast is dried into a paste and then mixed with magical ashes, pigments, and dusts, the resulting paint gains a strange property. Objects coated with this paint can only be described as elusive, as they pass under the notice of anybody who is not actively looking for them.
displacer-beast	Displacer Beast	20	Displacer Beast Hide	200 gp	25 lb.	Cloak of Displacement (DMG)		200	25	1		The hide of the displacer beast houses most of the magic that allows it to use its signature displacement ability. It is difficult to properly skin this magical creature without ruining the hide, but if done properly, the result can be used as the basis for the ever useful cloak of displacement.
doppelganger	Doppelganger	10	Doppelganger Blood	4 gp	1 lb.		vial	4	1	3	 (3 vials)	The blood of the doppelganger is unnervingly slick and in its natural state carries the same rainbow sheen as a puddle of oil. When it is being held, it changes colour to match the blood of the creature holding it. Use: When you drink a vial of this blood that has had a drop of a humanoid's blood mixed into it, you polymorph into a form identical to that humanoid for the next 1d4 hours. Your statistics, other than your size remain the same in that form. Any equipment you are carrying or wearing is not transformed. You revert to your true form at the end of the duration or if you die.
doppelganger	Doppelganger	15	Doppelganger Face	60 gp	3 lb.	Hat of Disguise (DMG)		60	3	1		"Although the thought may be unpleasent, the skinned face of the doppelganger can provide several uses when used as a mask. Even in death, the doppelganger's face maintains a ""muscle memory"" of the last few identities that it impersonated. With some concentration, someone wearing the face can force it to dredge up this memory and change the wearer's appearance to that identity. Use: While wearing the doppelganger face, a creature may spend 1 minute visualising a humanoid that the doppelganger has shapeshifted into within the past 24 hours. At the end of that minute, the face mask fuses with the wearer, causing their head to shapeshift into a perfect replica of the visualised humanoid along with their voice. Nothing else about the wearer's body changes however. After 24 hours, the mask seperates from the wearer, transforming them back into their regular form. The mask then deteriorates into a useless sheet of skin."
doppelganger	Doppelganger	20	Doppelganger Brain	200 gp	5 lb.	Helm of Telepathy (DMG)		200	5	1		A doppelganger's deception is aided by their low level of telepathic ability. Careful dissection of their brain can yield dark lobes that may be used by an artificer to create a helmet with similar telepathic abilities.
dracolich	Dracolich	10	Dracolich Bone	1,000 gp	20 lb.	Dracolich Censer		1000	20	1		The process that transforms a dragon carcass into a dracolich does more than simply slough off flesh and skin, it also changes the entire nature of the dragon and suffuses it with an unholy energy that marks it even after the dracolich's spirit is driven off once again. If these bones are taken, ground to a dust and then infused in a magical censer, the user can divine the location of the dracolich's spirit gem and put an end to it once and for all.
dragon-shadow	Dragon, Shadow	15	Shadowflame Ember	140 gp	1 lb.	Shadowflame Oil	enchanted vial	140	1	3	 (3 vials)	"After death, a shadow dragon's ""flame"" quickly snuffs itself out, dissolving into the shadows around it. If one is quick however, they can capture an ember in an enchanted vial to be used for later. Requires enchanted vial"
dragon-shadow	Dragon, Shadow	20	Shadow Dragon Scale (large bag) (only harvestable from dragon's that have progressed beyond the wyrmling stage)	1,000 gp	60 lb.	Dusk Armour		1000	60	1		The scales of the shadow dragon are a curious colour that can only be described as the colour of a shadow at dusk. Despite their ethereal appearance however, they maintain their incredible durability and strength. If forged into a suit of armour, it can make even the bulkiest of knights disappear when in darkness.
dragon-shadow	Dragon, Shadow	25	Shadowdragon Wing  (only harvestable from adult and ancient dragons)	1,500 gp	50 lb.	Shadow Wing Cape		1500	50	2	 (x2)	The ever shifting wings of the shadow dragon make it appear more like a dark cloud when it swoops upon its prey. They are more fragile than regular dragon wings and require great care when harvested, however these same special properties make them invaluable when crafting implements of flight and stealth.
ancient-dragon	Ancient Dragon	10	Dragon Flesh	150 gp	30 lb.			150	30	1		Despite common misconception, dragon flesh does not contain any magical benefit. It does however contain many culinary benefits. The exact flavour differs depending on the type of dragon it was taken from, but anybody that has eaten a dragon steak claims that it puts even the most exquisite aged beef to shame. There are many royal cooks and larders that would pay a high sum for just a pound of this delicacy.
ancient-dragon	Ancient Dragon	10	[Type] Dragon Blood	300 gp	1 lb.	Potion of Dragonstrength	vial	300	1	9	 (9 vials)	The blood of an ancient dragon is one of the most powerful spell reagents and potion ingredients in existence. Even besides its use in the birth of half-dragon soldiers and other rituals, the most common use of potent dragon blood is to make a potion that can imbue the drinker with the same strengths as the dragon it was taken from.
ancient-dragon	Ancient Dragon	15	[Type] Dragon Tooth	60 gp	14 lb.	[Type] Dragon Arrow or [Type] Dragon Bolt		60	14	15	 (x15)	The teeth of a full grown ancient dragon have been the end of many a hapless adventurer. Longer than a full grown human's arm, constant exposure to the dragon's breath attack has infused them with a modicum of elemental power. A master fletcher can craft a special set of arrows from these teeth, still carrying their original elemental charge.
ancient-dragon	Ancient Dragon	15	[Type] Dragon Bone	900 gp	20 lb.	Dragon Bone Weapon		900	20	6	 (x6)	The bones of a dragon are as hard and durable as the rest of their body. Not many weaponsmiths know how to reshape dragon bone, and those that do, keep it a guarded secret (most likely to avoid the ire of paranoid dragons). However, there is a good reason that myths and legends of heroes carrying dragonbone weapons abound in every culture: anyone who has seen one will agree that they simply have no equal.
ancient-dragon	Ancient Dragon	15	[Type] Dragon Horn/Spine	1,600 gp	30 lb	[Type] Dragon Wand		1600	30	1		Depending on the type of dragon, a horn or a prominent spine may adorn their head. In either case, the bony protrusion may be sawed off and used as a basis for exceptionally powerful wands and staves.
ancient-dragon	Ancient Dragon	20	[Type] Dragon Scales (large bag)	4,000 gp	45 lb	[Type] Dragon Scale Mail (DMG)		4000	45	1		The notoriously hard scales of an ancient dragon. Harder than steel yet surprisingly light, it is the dream of every armoursmith to craft a suit from this legendary material. Getting them is easier said than done however, as not only must one kill an ancient dragon first, they must also manage to find and safely detach the right scales needeed to interlock into a functioning set of armour.
ancient-dragon	Ancient Dragon	20	[Type] Dragon Breath Pouch	4,000 gp	15 lb.	[Type] Dragon's Wrath		4000	15	1		"When the word ""dragon"" is uttered, people tend to think of three things: wings, scales, and breath. Located at the back of the dragon's throat is a basket sized sack of magical liquids that the dragon naturally produces. While the liquid and their resulting exhalation differ depending on the dragon, they all share the same destructive results. Harvesting one of these without rupturing them is almost as difficult as killing its host in the first place, but the result is a concentrated pouch of destruction. Use: May be thrown up to 15 feet, upon which the pouch explodes. Any target within 15 feet of the explosion must roll a saving throw or suffer the effects of the primary breath weapon that the pouch was harvested from. The saving throw type and DC, the damage type, and the damage amount are identical to the breath weapon of the dragon it was harvested from."
ancient-dragon	Ancient Dragon	20	[Type] Secondary Dragon Breath Pouch (Metallic Dragons only)	4,000 gp	15 lb.	[Type] Dragon's Mercy		4000	15	1		The metallic dragons are considered to be less violent than their chromatic cousins and this is reflected in their alternate breath weapons. While their primary breath weapons mimic those of the chromatics, all metallics dragons wield a secondary, much less harmful breath weapon. This too can be harvested and used for similar purposes as the primary dragon breath pouch. Use: May be thrown up to 15 feet, upon which the pouch explodes. Any target within 15 feet of the explosion must roll a saving throw or suffer the effects of the secondary breath weapon that the pouch was harvested from. The saving throw type, DC, and the effect are identical to the secondary breath weapon of the dragon it was harvested from.
ancient-dragon	Ancient Dragon	25	Dragon Wing	8,000 gp	120 lb.	Cloak of Dragonflight		8000	120	2	 (x2)	The wings of a dragon defy any sense of natural law. Even considering their own immense size, they could not possibly lift a form as massive as the ancient dragon they bear, and yet they do. Only a magical force, inherent in their leathery membranes, could make such flight possible. Cloaks fashioned from these membranes can provide similar propulsion to other creatures, along with providing a stylistic fashion choice.
ancient-dragon	Ancient Dragon	30	Dragon Heart	26,000 gp	65 lb.	Dragon Stone		26000	65	1		Whether they were good or evil, a dragon is a akin to a force of nature and possessing the heart of an ancient dragon is no small matter (even ignoring the fact that it is the size of a large dwarf). Through ancient rituals and careful forging, the heart can be transformed into a crystal that imparts the traits of a dragon onto its wielder; for better or for worse.
adult-dragon	Adult Dragon	10	Dragon Flesh	60 gp	20 lb.			60	20	1		Despite common misconception, dragon flesh does not contain any magical benefit. It does however contain many culinary benefits. The exact flavour differs depending on the type of dragon it was taken from, but anybody that has eaten a dragon steak claims that it puts even the most exquisite aged beef to shame.

adult-dragon	Adult Dragon	10	[Type] Dragon Blood	250 gp	1 lb.	Potion of Dragonstrength	vial	250	1	7	 (7 vials)	The blood of an adult dragon is not as potent as that of an ancient dragon, but it is still a very powerful spell reagent. The most common use of dragon blood is to make a potion that can imbue the drinker with the same strengths as the dragon it was taken from.
adult-dragon	Adult Dragon	15	[Type] Dragon Tooth	50 gp	12 lb.	[Type] Dragon Arrow or [Type] Dragon Bolt		50	12	10	 (x10)	The teeth of an adult dragon have been the end of many a hapless adventurer.

adult-dragon	Adult Dragon	20	[Type] Dragon Scales (large bag)	3,350 gp	45 lb	[Type] Dragon Scale Mail (DMG)		3350	45	1		The incredibly hard scales of an adult dragon. While not as strong as ancient dragon scales, they are still durable enough to deflect all but the toughest of blows. Getting them is easier said than done however, as not only must one kill an adult dragon first, they must also manage to find and safely detach the right scales needeed to interlock into a functioning set of armour.

Longer than a full grown halfling's arm, constant exposure to the dragon's breath weapon has infused them with a modicum of elemental power. A master fletcher can craft a special set of arrows from these teeth, still carrying their original elemental charge.
young-dragon	Young Dragon	15	[Type] Dragon Bone	375 gp	14 lb.	Dragon Bone Weapon		375	14	6	 (x6)	The bones of a dragon are as hard and durable as the rest of their body. Not many weaponsmiths know how to reshape dragon bone, and those that do, keep it a guarded secret (most likely to avoid the ire of paranoid dragons). However, there is a good reason that myths and legends of heroes carrying dragonbone weapons abound in every culture: anyone who has seen one will agree that they simply have no equal.
young-dragon	Young Dragon	15	[Type] Dragon Horn/Spine	650 gp	20 lb	[Type] Dragon Wand		650	20	1		Depending on the type of dragon, a horn or a prominent spine may adorn their head. In either case, the bony protrusion may be sawed off and used as a basis for exceptionally powerful wands and staves.
young-dragon	Young Dragon	20	[Type] Dragon Scales (large bag)	1,675 gp	45 lb	[Type] Dragon Scale Mail (DMG)		1675	45	1		The scales of a young dragon. Some of these scales are still the supple flexible plates from their wyrmling years, particularly if they have not had many chances to moult. Getting them is easier said than done however, as not only must one kill a dragon first, they must also manage to find and safely detach the right scales needeed to interlock into a functioning set of armour.
young-dragon	Young Dragon	20	[Type] Dragon Breath Pouch	1,675 gp	12 lb.	[Type] Dragon's Wrath		1675	12	1		"When the word ""dragon"" is uttered, people tend to think of three things: wings, scales, and breath. Located at the back of the dragon's throat is a basket sized sack of magical liquids that the dragon naturally produces. While the liquid and their resulting exhalation differ depending on the dragon, they all share the same destructive results. Harvesting one of these without rupturing them is almost as difficult as killing its host in the first place, but the result is a concentrated pouch of destruction. Use: May be thrown up to 15 feet, upon which the pouch explodes. Any target within 15 feet of the explosion must roll a saving throw or suffer the effects of the primary breath weapon that the pouch was harvested from. The saving throw type and DC, the damage type, and the damage amount are identical to the breath weapon of the dragon it was harvested from."
young-dragon	Young Dragon	20	[Type] Secondary Dragon Breath Pouch (Metallic Dragons only)	1,675 gp	12 lb.	[Type] Dragon's Mercy		1675	12	1		The metallic dragons are considered to be less violent than their chromatic cousins and this is reflected in their alternate breath weapons. While their primary breath weapons mimic those of the chromatics, all metallics dragons wield a secondary, much less harmful breath weapon. This too can be harvested and used for similar purposes as the primary dragon breath pouch. Use: May be thrown up to 15 feet, upon which the pouch explodes. Any target within 15 feet of the explosion must roll a saving throw or suffer the effects of the secondary breath weapon that the pouch was harvested from. The saving throw type, DC, and the effect are identical to the secondary breath weapon of the dragon it was harvested from.
young-dragon	Young Dragon	25	Dragon Wing	3,250 gp	60 lb.	Cloak of Dragonflight		3250	60	2	 (x2)	The wings of a dragon defy any sense of natural law. Even considering their own immense size, they could not possibly lift a form as massive as the ancient dragon they bear, and yet they do. Only a magical force, inherent in their leathery membranes, could make such flight possible. Cloaks fashioned from these membranes can provide similar propulsion to other creatures, along with providing a stylistic fashion choice.
wyrmling	Wyrmling	10	Dragon Flesh	3 gp	1 lb.			3	1	1		Despite common misconception, dragon flesh does not contain any magical benefit. It does however contain many culinary benefits. The exact flavour differs depending on the type of dragon it was taken from, but anybody that has eaten a dragon steak claims that it puts even the most exquisite aged beef to shame. There are many royal cooks and larders that would pay a high sum for just a pound of this delicacy.
wyrmling	Wyrmling	10	[Type] Dragon Blood	65 gp	1 lb.	Potion of Dragonstrength	vial	65	1	3	 (3 vials)	The blood of a dragon wyrmling is barely potent enough to be used as a spell reagent, but many find that it's thinner consistency makes for a more potable potion.The most common use of dragon blood is to make a potion that can imbue the drinker with the same strengths as the dragon it was taken from.
wyrmling	Wyrmling	15	[Type] Dragon Breath Pouch	160 gp	7 lb.	[Type] Dragon's Wrath		160	7	1		"When the word ""dragon"" is uttered, people tend to think of three things: wings, scales, and breath. Located at the back of the dragon's throat is a basket sized sack of magical liquids that the dragon naturally produces. While the liquid and their resulting exhalation differ depending on the dragon, they all share the same destructive results. Harvesting one of these without rupturing them is almost as difficult as killing its host in the first place, but the result is a concentrated pouch of destruction.

wyrmling	Wyrmling	20	[Type] Secondary Dragon Breath Pouch (Metallic Dragons only)	160 gp	7 lb.	[Type] Dragon's Mercy		160	7	1		The metallic dragons are considered to be less violent than their chromatic cousins and this is reflected in their alternate breath weapons. While their primary breath weapons mimic those of the chromatics, all metallics dragons wield a secondary, much less harmful breath weapon. This too can be harvested and used for similar purposes as the primary dragon breath pouch. Use: May be thrown up to 15 feet, upon which the pouch explodes.

The saving throw type, DC, and the effect are identical to the secondary breath weapon of the dragon it was harvested from.
dragon-turtle	Dragon Turtle	10	Dragon Turtle Blood (1,000 gallons)	1 gp	9 lb.	Ocean Master Paint		1	9	1		An old sailor's adage held that the dragon turtle was the king of the ocean and that no denizen of the deeps would dare to approach them without permission. As such, it became a common good luck ritual to mix dragon turtle blood with tar and coat important ships with it. Later research found that this ritual was more than just a folk tale and that certain aquatic creatures have developed an instinctual revulsion when they smell a dragon turtle nearby.
dragon-turtle	Dragon Turtle	15	Dragon Turtle Plastron (3 large pouches of shards) 	400 gp	20 lb.	Dragon Turtle Jelly		400	20	1		The plastron of the dragon turtle is the cartilage-like substance that protects the underbelly of the dragon turtle. Not nearly as tough as the shell of the dragon turtle, it nonetheless has its uses. When ground up, mixed with herbs, and set into a jelly, it creates a life-saving (if unpalatable) medicine.
dragon-turtle	Dragon Turtle	20	Steam Ventral	3,000 gp	30 lb.			3000	30	1		A basket sized organ located alongside the lungs. When the dragon turtle inhales water, some is stored inside this organ, where it reacts with enzymes that rapidly accelerate heating. While it appears nominally that this organ is meant to provide the dragon turtle with warmth during its deep sea dives, it doubles as a defense mechanism, allowing the dragon turtle to spit jets of scalding steam from its mouth. When harvested, it maintains this property, but lacks both the muscular support for long ranges and the ability to refill on enzymes, giving it a short shelf life. Use: As an action, a creature may squeeze the steam ventral to release a 30-foot cone of scalding steam. Each creature in that area must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking 15d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Being underwater doesn't grant resistsance against this damage. This ability can only be used within 48 hours of the dragon turtle's death. Once used, the steam ventral is emptied out and rendered useless.
dragon-turtle	Dragon Turtle	25	Dragon Turtle Shell Shard	6,000 gp	10 lb.	Shield, +3 (DMG)		6000	10	1		Almost thicker than the scales of an ancient dragon, the shell of a dragon turtle is able to deflect almost anything the sea can throw at it. Although it can be difficult to find one that is suitable, a shard of a dragon turtle's shell can make for one of the finest shields known outside of legends.
drider	Drider	10	Drider Oil	4 gp	1 lb.		vial	4	1	4	 (4 vials)	Anybody who has observed a spider will notice that they do not stick to their own webs, and a drider is no exception. For the drider, this comes in the form of a gland that secretes an oily substance that covers the almost invisible hairs on their legs. This oil prevents them from sticking to any sort of webbing and also contributes to the black sheen on their bodies. Use: 1 vial contains enough oil to cover one medium or smaller sized creature. A creature covered by this oil gains the drider's web walker feature for the next hour.
drider	Drider	15	Drider Poison	20 gp	1 lb.		vial	20	1	1	 (vial)	Drider poison is just as deadly as those of the cave spiders it emulates. By removing the gland from under the drider's tongue however, this poison can be extracted and put to better use. Use: Can coat up to 5 pieces of slashing or piercing ammunition or 1 slashing or piercing weapon for 10 minutes. Applying the poison takes 1 minute. Any creature successfully hit receives an additional 2d8 poison damage. 
drider	Drider	20	Mark of Lolth	40 gp	1 lb.	Drow Amulet		40	1	1		Unbenownst to many is that each drider is marked by more than just the physical transformation of their lower body into that of a giant spider. Each drider also receives a permanent mark in the shape of the symbol of Lolth. The issue is that the location of this mark changes with each individual drider, so a thorough investigation of the carcass is required to find it. Once that is done however, the mark provides uses in channelling certain powers from the drow goddess, even against her own will.
dryad	Dryad	5	Dryad Hair	2 sp	3 lb.			0.2	3	1		Hair is used as a loose term, as the material covering a dryad's head more resembles loose foliage and vines than actual hair. Still, it is beautiful to behold and surprisingly strong. More ostentatious adventurers use the hair as rope to commemorate their conquest of a dryad...in either sense of the term.
dryad	Dryad	10	Dryad Sap	8 sp	1 lb.		vial	0.8	1	1	 (vial)	Instead of blood, dryads have a sap-like substance flowing through their bodies. This sap contains magical properties and can enhance the durability of a creature that is rubbed on. Use: Can be used to coat one medium or smaller creature. Applying the sap takes 1 minute, after which the sap takes effect. While under the effect of the sap, that creature is under an effect idential to that of the barkskin spell. This effect does not require any concentration check to maintain however. This effect lasts for 1 hour.
dryad	Dryad	15	Dryad Eye	4 gp	1 lb.	Eyes of Charming (DMG)		4	1	2	 (x2)	Many who have wandered through the forest at night can attest to seeing two orbs of silver or gold, dancing through the tree branches, and beckoning them to join them. These are usually the eyes of a dryad, and there are not many living creatures that can gaze into them and not be enthralled. The eyes maintain these properties even after the dryad is killed and their eyes transfigured into useful equipment for adventurers.
duergar	Duergar	10	Duergar Brainstem	2 gp	2 lb.	Potion of Growth (DMG) or Potion of Invisibility (DMG) 		2	2	1		Due to their years of slavery to the illithid race, duergar have developed a range of psionic powers. Some of these powers are inherent in any member of their race regardless of training. If one dissects the brain of a duergar, they will find that their brainstem is particularly large and often pulsates even after death. This brainstem may be used as an ingredient in various potions that temporarily grant the drinker the same powers as an average duergar.
air-elemental	Air Elemental	15	Mote of Air	100 gp	1 lb.	Elemental Gem (Blue Sapphire) (DMG)	enchanted vial	100	1	1		When an air elemental's summoned form is dispersed, it leaves behind small clumps of dust that continue to carry trace amounts of elemental energy. These need to be collected quickly in specialised containers to prevent further degradation. If collected properly, they can then be used to craft an elemental gem. Requires enchanted vial.
earth-elemental	Earth Elemental	15	Mote of Earth	100 gp	1 lb.	Elemental Gem (Yellow Diamond) (DMG)	enchanted vial	100	1	1		When an earth elemental's summoned form is dispersed, it leaves behind small clods of dirt that continue to carry trace amounts of elemental energy. These need to be collected quickly in specialised containers to prevent further degradation. If collected properly, they can then be used to craft an elemental gem. Requires enchanted vial.
fire-elemental	Fire Elemental	15	Mote of Fire	100 gp	1 lb.	Elemental Gem (Red Corundum) (DMG)	enchanted vial	100	1	1		When a fire elemental's summoned form is dispersed, it leaves behind small embers that continue to carry trace amounts of elemental energy. These need to be collected quickly in specialised containers to prevent further degradation. If collected properly, they can then be used to craft an elemental gem. Requires enchanted vial.
water-elemental	Water Elemental	15	Mote of Water	100 gp	1 lb.	Elemental Gem (Emerald) (DMG)	enchanted vial	100	1	1		When a water elemental's summoned form is dispersed, it leaves behind small balls of foam that continue to carry trace amounts of elemental energy. These need to be collected quickly in specialised containers to prevent further degradation. If collected properly, they can then be used to craft an elemental gem. Requires enchanted vial.
drow-br-	Drow	10	Drow Blood	1 gp	1 lb.	Drow Poison	vial	1	1	3	 (3 vials)	Any adventurer that has delved into the Underdark and met the drow has probably also encountered their signature poison. For centuries, surface alchemists tried and failed to replicate the formula, citing a single missing ingredient that they could not identify. It was only recently discovered why only drow could create the poison: it was manufactured from their own blood. For whatever reason, whether it be their diet, their cursed state, or just the whims of Lolth, drow blood possesses some unique property that when rebrewed with other fungi and mosses in the Underdark, create a noxious poison that renders the victim helpless in the face of their drow pursuers.
drow-elite-warrior	Drow Elite Warrior	10	Drow Blood	1 gp	1 lb.	Drow Poison	vial	1	1	3	 (3 vials)	Any adventurer that has delved into the Underdark and met the drow has probably also encountered their signature poison. For centuries, surface alchemists tried and failed to replicate the formula, citing a single missing ingredient that they could not identify. It was only recently discovered why only drow could create the poison: it was manufactured from their own blood. For whatever reason, whether it be their diet, their cursed state, or just the whims of Lolth, drow blood possesses some unique property that when rebrewed with other fungi and mosses in the Underdark, create a noxious poison that renders the victim helpless in the face of their drow pursuers.
drow-mage	Drow Mage	10	Drow Blood	1 gp	1 lb.	Drow Poison	vial	1	1	3	 (3 vials)	Any adventurer that has delved into the Underdark and met the drow has probably also encountered their signature poison. For centuries, surface alchemists tried and failed to replicate the formula, citing a single missing ingredient that they could not identify. It was only recently discovered why only drow could create the poison: it was manufactured from their own blood. For whatever reason, whether it be their diet, their cursed state, or just the whims of Lolth, drow blood possesses some unique property that when rebrewed with other fungi and mosses in the Underdark, create a noxious poison that renders the victim helpless in the face of their drow pursuers.
drow-mage	Drow Mage	15	Drow Heart	30 gp	1 lb.			30	1	1		Obviously, every drow has a heart (despite any evidence to the contrary), yet only the powerful in their society are blessed enough by Lolth for their hearts to be worth anything. As a drow climbs in their society, Lolth's rewards to them begin to compound, causing them to become slightly more magical. Upon their death, their hearts may be removed and this magic released to simulate the gifts that Lolth once offered them in life. Use: By using an action to stab the heart with a knife, the user may use the summon demon ability listed in the drow mage's statblock. After this, the heart is rendered useless. In order to use this ability, the user must be able to cast the summon lesser demon spell. 
drow-priestess-of-lolth	Drow Priestess of Lolth	10	Drow Blood	1 gp	1 lb.	Drow Poison	vial	1	1	3	 (3 vials)	Any adventurer that has delved into the Underdark and met the drow has probably also encountered their signature poison. For centuries, surface alchemists tried and failed to replicate the formula, citing a single missing ingredient that they could not identify. It was only recently discovered why only drow could create the poison: it was manufactured from their own blood. For whatever reason, whether it be their diet, their cursed state, or just the whims of Lolth, drow blood possesses some unique property that when rebrewed with other fungi and mosses in the Underdark, create a noxious poison that renders the victim helpless in the face of their drow pursuers.
drow-priestess-of-lolth	Drow Priestess of Lolth	15	Drow Heart	30 gp	1 lb.			30	1	1		Obviously, every drow has a heart (despite any evidence to the contrary), yet only the powerful in their society are blessed enough by Lolth for their hearts to be worth anything. As a drow climbs in their society, Lolth's rewards to them begin to compound, causing them to become slightly more magical. Upon their death, their hearts may be removed and this magic released to simulate the gifts that Lolth once offered them in life. Use: By using an action to stab the heart with a knife, the user may use the summon demon ability listed in the drow priestess' statblock. After this, the heart is rendered useless. In order to use this ability, the user must be able to cast the summon lesser demon spell.
drow-priestess-of-lolth	Drow Priestess of Lolth	20	Mark of Lolth	40 gp	1 lb.	Drow Amulet		40	1	1		As a symbol of their eternal worship to their dark mistress, priestesses of Lolth have her brand permanently marked onto their bodies. If harvested and preserved properly, its powers can be transferred to an amulet that can channel the Spider Goddess' powers, whether she likes it or not.
empyrean	Empyrean	10	Lock of Empyrean Hair	25 gp	1 lb.			25	1	10	 (x10)	The hair of an empyrean is akin to silk in both its lustre and texture, another sign of their celestial heritage. As such, it makes wonderful material for making hardy ties and ropes. If you want to use it for less mundane purposes however, it makes for a good material component in the augury spell; the hairs changing colour depending on your fate. It would be advised however not to attempt this if your benefactor was also this empyrean's parent.
empyrean	Empyrean	15	Empyrean Blood	300 gp	1 lb.	Potion of Celestial Might	vial	300	1	7	 (7 vials)	If the empyrean's skin and size didn't already give away their divine provenance, their blood surely will. Gold and sparkling for good aligned empyreans, black and viscous for evil aligned empyreans, this blood contains many magical properties, especially in alchemy. Drinkers of any potion brewed from empyrean blood should beware though, as doing so is a blasphemous act that marks the drinker permanently in the eyes of the empyrean's parent. 
empyrean	Empyrean	20	Marble Skin	6,000 gp	25 lb.	Studded Leather Armour +3 (DMG)		6000	25	1		The skin of an empyrean resembles that of living marble and shares much of its durability. It takes a very steady hand and great skill to remove it without shattering it into a thousand pieces, but the result is a hide that flexes like leather but protects like stone.
empyrean	Empyrean	25	Empyrean Heart	20,000 gp	10 lb.	Crown of Celestial Rule		20000	10	1		The heart of an empyrean seems to carry an otherworldly energy when held, and people who gaze upon one often mention feeling boosts in confidence and mood. Use: As an action you may squeeze the heart, activating a pulse of emotional energy and inspiration that bolsters all nonhostile creatures within 120 feet. Bolstered creatures can't be charmed or frightened, and they gain advantage on ability checks and saving throws until the end of the wielder's next turn. This ability may be used 3 times, after which, the heart withers away.
ettercap	Ettercap	10	Ettercap Poison	4 gp	1 lb.		vial	4	1	1	 (vial)	Ettercaps secrete a noxious venom from their fangs that weakens any creature unfortunate enough to fall prey to it. By removing the poison gland, one can easily harvest some of this poison for their own use. Use: Can be used to coat up to 3 pieces of slashing or piercing ammunition or one slashing or piercing weapon. Applying the poison takes 1 minute. For the next minute, any creature successfully hit by this wepaon must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
ettercap	Ettercap	15	Web Gland	8 gp	5 lb.			8	5	1		Like a real spider, the ettercap is capable of dispensing web from glands housed in its abdomen. The gland is rather delicate once removed from its host, but the silk contained within is well regarded as a material for ropes and other items. Alternatively, it can just be lobbed at a foe to make a sticky explosion. Use: As an action, you may throw the web gland up to 15 feet. Upon impact with the ground, the web gland explodes, forcing all creatures within 5 feet to succeed on a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw or be restrained by webbing. As an action, the restrained creature can make a DC 11 Strength check, escaping from the webbing on a success. The effect ends if the webbing is destroyed. The webbing has AC 10, 5 hit points, resistance to bludgeoning damage, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. 
ettin	Ettin	10	Ettin Fingernail	30 gp	2 lb.	Potion of Giant Srength (Hill) (DMG)		30	2	1		Like other giants, the fingernail sliver of an ettin is a key ingredient in the brewing of a potion of giant strength, in this case, acting as a stand in for a hill giant's. Despite the misconception among adventurers who believe that felling one giant can supply them potions for life, only one potion can be brewed per giant. This is because the alchemical process uses the fingernail as a channeling foci to summon that particular giant's strength and thus renders any other attempts moot.
ettin	Ettin	15	Ettin Head	80 gp	25 lb.	Helm of Transmission		80	25	2	 (x2)	Though ettins are often witnessed physically talking to their twinned head, their unique physiology causes their brains to share information subconsciously; a trait that can be exploited through clever artificing. Indeed, it is probably ironic that despite being among the dumbest beings on the Material Plane, ettins are capable of mental techniques that elude even the most prestigious of minds.
faerie-dragon	Faerie Dragon	10	Faerie Dragon Blood	4 gp	1 lb.		vial	4	1	1	 (vial)	The blood of a faerie dragon is the same bright hue as its scales and also changes as the dragon ages. The blood's inherent magical properties makes it an excellent ink when transcribing spells. Use: If you attempt to transcribe a spell into your spellbook or spell scroll that was known to the faerie dragon you harvested this blood from, you may use this vial of blood instead of the regular ink. Doing so halves the regular time it would take to make that transcription, and the cost of the vial of blood is deducted from the total cost of the transcription.
faerie-dragon	Faerie Dragon	15	Faerie Dragon Lungs	6 gp	1 lb.			6	1	1		Faerie dragons are not altogether harmful, although they boast a number of traits that make them a nuisance to encounter. One such feature is their euphoria breath: a gas that temporarily incapacitates a creature that breathes it in. Special bronchials in the faerie dragon's lungs are responsible for the production of this gas, and still contain traces of it, even after the faerie dragon's death. Use: This ability may only be used if the faerie dragon had access to its euphoria breath ability at the time of its death. As an action, you may squeeze the faerie dragon's lungs at one creature within 5 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw, or for 1 minute, the target can't take reactions and must roll a d6 at the start of each of its turns to determine its behaviour during the turn. Refer to the euphoria breath ability in the faerie dragon's statblock for potential results.
faerie-dragon	Faerie Dragon	20	Faerie Dragon Wing	6 gp	1 lb.	Faerie Dragon Dust		6	1	2	 (x2)	The wings of a faerie dragon resemble that of a butterfly in more ways than one. Besides their diaphonous texture, they also possess a light coating of dust that enhances their invisibility magic and aids them in their flight. If harvested undamaged, these wings may be crushed, powdered, and mixed with powdered catalyst gems to enchant objects with flight and invisibility.
flameskull	Flameskull	10	Flameskull Ashes (small pouch)	20 gp	1 lb.			20	1	1		"After a flameskull is destroyed, the magical flames that surrounded it leave behind an ashy residue around the skull. These ashes contain ""memories"" of the magic that the flameskull knew in life, and may be used as a special pigment for wizards trying to expand their spellbook. Use: A character may add any spell available to the flameskull to their own spellbook as if they had found the spell in a spellscroll or similar. Doing so follows the same rules as the copying a spell into the book rules on page 114 of the Player's Handbook, using the flameskull ashes instead of ink. The character may deduct the cost of the flameskull ashes from the overall cost of copying the spell."
flameskull	Flameskull	15	Flameskull	60gp	6 lb.	Skull of Revelation		60	6	1		A flameskull is a cursed creature, an echo of the brilliance it had in its mortal life. Even after the skull has been defeated and its essence cleansed, the physical skull still contains traces of the magic it once had. If you are willing to further disgrace the wizard that the skull came from, a few choice runes and inlays on the skull can bring out this magic to your own advantage.
flumph	Flumph	5	Flumph Spray	1 sp	1 lb.		vial	0.1	1	1	 (vial)	The flumph is mostly harmless and overall friendly. Even their self defense method is mostly harmless; an obnoxious smelling fluid that sends most other creatures scurrying away. Use: As an action, you may throw the vial of flumph spray up to 20 feet away, shattering it on impact. Each creature within 5 feet of the target location must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or be coated in a foul-smelling liquid. A coated creature exudes a horrible stench for 1d4 hours. The coated creature is poisoned as long as the stench lasts, and other creatures are poisoned while within 5 feet of the coated creature. A creature can remove the stench on itself by using a short rest to bathe in water, alcohol, or vinegar.
flumph	Flumph	10	Flumph Membrane	8 sp	2 lb.	Mood Cap		0.8	2	1		The flumph is immune to any form of psionic or magical divination and telepathic probes. This is in part due to the thin membrane around its soft body that serves a similar function to the epiglottis in humanoids. This membrane prevents the flumph from psionically feeding on every creature around it, and is only turned off manually when the flumph is hungry. This membrane however does break down quickly with the death of the flumph. Use: While a creature is wearing the flumph membrane over their head, they are immune to any effect that would sense its emotions or read its thoughts, as well as all divination spells. The membrane loses this trait 24 hours after the death of its flumph.
flumph	Flumph	15	Flumph Brain	1 gp	2 lb.	Potion of Detect Thoughts (DMG)		1	2	1		The brain of the flumph is a powerful telepathic organ despite the overall appearance of the flumph itself. When rendered down and bolstered with psionically prone catalysts, the brain makes a potion that can provide the drinker with many of the same abilities.
fomorian	Fomorian	10	Fomorian Growth	20 gp	1 lb.	Potion of Ruined Flesh		20	1	5	 (x5)	The many carbuncles, blisters, pustules, and boils of a fomorian may seem disgusting, but as marks of their ancient curse they actually hold small amounts of magical signatures. Alchemists have been known to take these growths and brew a rather nasty, but ultimately harmless potion.
fomorian	Fomorian	15	Fomorian Eye	250 gp	2 lb.	Fomorian Crystal		250	2	1		"The infamous ""evil eye"" of the fomorian. Known for inflicting curses and great pain upon any who draw the ire of its host. Even when removed from its socket, it seems to stare back at whomever gazes at it. "
gas-spore	Gas Spore	10	Gas Spore Gas	5 sp	1 lb.	Floating Oil	enchanted vial	0.5	1	1	 (vial)	The lighter than air gas that allows a gas spore to fly remains potent even after it is popped. It takes a quick hand and a deep breath to bottle some without accidentally breathing deadly gas spores, however. Requires enchanted vial.
gas-spore	Gas Spore	15	Gas Spore Colony	1 gp	1 lb.		vial	1	1	1	 (vial)	Collecting the deadly spores of a gas spore must be done within one round of the creature's death, as spores that land in inorganic matter become useless. Collection of these spores must be done in a vial that contains a few drops of a creature's blood to give the spore colony the nutrients it needs to survive. While the spores are dangerous to inhale, drinking them also carries a risk, unless the spores are dropped in alcohol, which kills the spores. Use: As an action, the vial may be thrown up to 20 feet at a target creature, shattering on impact. Make a ranged attack against that creature. On a successful hit, that creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer the effects described in the death burst trait of the gas spore's statblock. This item must be used within 24 hours of the death of the initial gas spore's death, otherwise the colony will grow too large in the vial to properly invade another creature's system.
shrieker	Shrieker	15	Shrieker Spore Colony	5 gp	1 lb.		vial	5	1	1	 (vial)	"It is difficult to remove the gills of a shrieker without damaging them, however it yields a bounty of spores that can be used in the production of the drink ""Shrieker Scotch,"" the taste of which has been described as ""loud."" If you are not a fan of alcohol, it can simply be used for magical purposes. Use: The shrieker spore colony may be expended as a material component when casting the alarm spell. When cast in this way, the caster does not use a spell slot."
violet-fungus	Violet Fungus	15	Violet Fungus Stalk	2 gp	2 lb.	Gut Rot		2	2	1		The stalk of the violet fungus contains an untold number of bacteria, spores, and other nasties that rots flesh from a slight touch. When this stalk is pulped, strained, and then added to a stabilising solution, it creates the insidious poison: gut rot.
galeb-duhr	Galeb-Duhr	10	Enchanted Pumice	10 gp	2 lb.	Living Chalk		10	2	1		The joints of a galeb-duhr are of a slightly different mineral compound resembling pumice. This is presumably to facilitate easier movement for the creatures. While it is extraordinarily brittle once its animating force is destroyed, it makes for an excellent ingredient for magical chalk.
galeb-duhr	Galeb-Duhr	15	Mote of Earth	100 gp	2 lb.	Elemental Gem (Yellow Diamond)	enchanted vial	100	2	1		When a galeb-duhr's form is dispersed, it leaves behind small clods of dirt that continue to carry trace amounts of elemental energy. These need to be collected quickly in specialised containers to prevent further degredation. If collected properly, they can then be used to craft an elemental gem. Requires enchanted vial.
galeb-duhr	Galeb-Duhr	20	Galeb-Duhr Core	115 gp	25 lb.			115	25	1		"Unlike a regular earth elemental, galeb-duhr's have a strong tie to the Material Plane, and this is reflected in their possession of a ""core."" Often referred to as the galeb-duhr's heart, this magical stone serves as the basis of the galeb-duhr and is the physical embodiment of their identity and form. If recovered undamaged, it can be used to create a new galeb-duhr. Use: The galeb-duhr core must be placed inside a pile of rocks the size of a medium humanoid on the night of a full moon. Until the next full moon, the person that placed the core must cast the conjure elemental spell on top of the chosen pile of rocks every day at the same hour as the placing and maintain concentration on the spell for the full hour. When cast in this way, no elemental actually appears, but the spell slot is still expended. If done correctly, the pile of rocks will coalesce into a galeb-duhr upon casting conjure elemental on the next full moon. The galeb-duhr is friendly to its summoner and understands anything its summoner says to it even if they do not share a language. The summoned galeb-duhr obeys any order its summoner gives to it to the best of its abilities. A galeb-duhr summoned in this way also remembers any memories its core had experienced in its previous lives. This galeb-duhr does not disappear at the end of the hour and is only dispersed upon its death."
gargoyle	Gargoyle	15	Shard of Elemental Evil	10 gp	1 lb.			10	1	1		Gargoyles are formed around the many shards of broken rock that the Prince of Elemental Earth, Ogremoch, leaves in his wake. While it only contains the tiniest fraction of his power, it still contains strong magic, and many alchemists value them as thickening agents in their potions. If needed, the shard may also be used in the scrying spell when divining for Ogremoch.
gargoyle	Gargoyle	20	Gargoyle Wings	20 gp	40 lb.	Gargoyle Wing Cloak		20	40	2	 (x2)	The gargoyle is a paradox; a creature made of stone and yet able to fly at amazing speeds. Although its wings are heavy, they manage to catch air just the way a bird's feathers might. While they are incredibly difficult for even the most experienced stonemasons to work with, they can be refashioned into a stone-like cloak that exhibits many strange qualities.
dao	Dao	15	Crystalline Powder	750 gp	3 lb.		enchanted vial	750	3	1	 (vial)	When a dao dies, its body disintigrates into a crystalline powder. Fast hands can capture this powder before it loses its magical essence which can then be used as a material component in many spells. Requires enchanted vial. Use: When casting the spell conjure elemental, you may use the crystalline powder as a material component to cast the spell as an action instead. The spell is also considered to be cast at one level higher than the spell slot you used to cast it. The crystalline powder then becomes inert and useless.
djinni	Djinni	15	Magical Breeze	750 gp	1 lb.		enchanted vial	750	1	1	 (vial)	When a djinni dies, its body disintigrates into a warm breeze. Fast hands can capture this breeze before it loses its magical essence which can then be used as a material component in many spells. Requires enchanted vial. Use: When casting the spell conjure elemental, you may use the magical breeze as a material component to cast the spell as an action instead. The spell is also considered to be cast at one level higher than the spell slot you used to cast it. The magical breeze then becomes inert and useless.
efreeti	Efreeti	15	Tyrant Smoke	750 gp	1 lb.		enchanted vial	750	1	1	 (vial)	When an efreeti dies, its body disintigrates into a flash of flame and smoke. Fast hands can capture this smoke before it loses its magical essence which can then be used as a material component in many spells. Requires enchanted vial. Use: When casting the spell conjure elemental, you may use the tyrant smoke as a material component to cast the spell as an action instead. The spell is also considered to be cast at one level higher than the spell slot you used to cast it. The tyrant smoke then becomes inert and useless.
marid	Marid	15	Enchanted Foam	750 gp	2 lb.		enchanted vial	750	2	1	 (vial)	When a marid dies, its body disintigrates into foam. Fast hands can capture this foam before it loses its magical essence which can then be used as a material component in many spells. Requires enchanted vial. Use: When casting the spell conjure elemental, you may use the enchanted foam as a material component to cast the spell as an action instead. The spell is also considered to be cast at one level higher than the spell slot you used to cast it. The enchanted foam then becomes inert and useless.
ghost	Ghost	10	Ectoplasmic Trail	15 gp	1 lb.	Oil of Etherealness (DMG)	enchanted vial	15	1	1	 (vial)	Rather than bleed blood as a living being would, a ghost instead drips a thin trail of slimy substance known as ectoplasm. Scholars still argue what exactly ectoplasm is, but the current prevailing theory is that it is created when matter from the Ethereal Plane collides with that in the Material Plane during the ghost's jaunts between them. Requires enchanted vial.
ghost	Ghost	20	Spirit Echo	120 gp	1 lb.	Spectral Gauntlets	spirit paper	120	1	1		A ghost has no corporeal form and thus leaves little behind to harvest from its actual body. Instead, using spirit paper, an echo of the ghost can be imprinted and stored for later use. Like any instance of using spirit paper, such an imprint is not the soul itself, but a fragile simulacrum. The imprint does possess all of the ghost's memories however, and responds to the speak with dead spell. Requires spirit paper.
ghast	Ghast	10	Ghast Blood	2 gp	2 lb.		vial	2	2	3	 (3 vials)	This black tar-like substance resembles the coagulated blood found on murdered corpses. If you have the stomach for it, it can be rubbed on one's body to mask the presence radiated by all living beings that the undead can detect. Use: You may spend 1 minute to cover yourself in ghast blood. If you do so, undead creatures with an Intelligence of less than 10 have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks to find you. This effect lasts for 1 hour or until the blood is washed off, whichever comes first. 
ghast	Ghast	10	Ghast Flesh	5 gp	5 lb.			5	5	1		The stench of a ghast is almost as debilitating as their touch. Nourished by and resembling decomposing meat, the flesh of a ghast can serve as a potent repellent in a pinch. Use: As an action, you may throw the ghast flesh up to 20 feet away, the corpulent flesh bursting on impact. Any creature within 5 feet of the targetted point must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of its next turn. On a successful saving throw, the creature is immune to the effects of the ghast flesh and the ghast's stench feature for 24 hours.
ghast	Ghast	15	Ghast Claws	10 gp	6 lb.	Paralysing Dust		10	6	2	 (x2)	The claws of the ghast are well known for their paralysing touch, and there are many a horror story of adventurers devoured alive by a ghast while they could do nothing but lie there helpless (of course one has to wonder how this story could be true if they are alive to tell it, but I digress.)
ghast	Ghast	20	Ghast Hide	40 gp	12 lb.	Bag of Colding		40	12	1		Despite its undead nature, a ghast does not rot or decompose. While this only adds to its unnerving nature, its skin does have certain properties useful for a harvester. Some of the original designs for the renowned bag of colding used ghast hide as its main material.
ghoul	Ghoul	15	Ghoul Claws	10 gp	6 lb.	Paralysing Dust		10	6	2	 (x2)	The claws of the ghoul are well known for their paralysing touch, and there are many a horror story of adventurers devoured alive by a ghast while they could do nothing but lie there helpless (of course one has to wonder how this story could be true if they are alive to tell it, but I digress.)
ghoul	Ghoul	20	Ghoul Hide	40 gp	12 lb.	Bag of Colding		40	12	1		Despite its undead nature, a ghoul does not rot or decompose. While this only adds to its unnerving nature, its skin does have certain properties useful for a harvester. Some of the original designs for the renowned bag of colding used ghoul hide as its main material.
cloud-giant	Cloud Giant	10	Lock of Cloud Giant Hair	55 gp	10 lb.			55	10	1		Resembling an errant nimbus, the hair of a cloud giant is considered a valuable textile component. Softer than silk and finer than wool, ostentatious mountain kings may wear vests of these hairs stitched together as both a sign of wealth, and as an affront to the giants themselves. 
cloud-giant	Cloud Giant	15	Cloud Giant Fingernail	250 gp	2 lb.	Potion of Giant Strength (Cloud)		250	2	1		Like all giants, the fingernail of the cloud giant is a key component in brewing the ubiquitous potion of giant strength. Despite the misconception among adventurers who believe that felling one giant can supply them potions for life, only one potion can be brewed per giant. This is because the alchemical process uses the fingernail as a channeling foci to summon that particular giant's strength and thus renders any other attempts moot.
cloud-giant	Cloud Giant	20	Cloud Giant Blood	70 gp	1 lb.	Cloud Step Oil	enchanted vial	70	1	7	 (7 vials)	Cloud giant blood exists in a strange transitive state of matter, not entirely gas, solid, or liquid. It seems to shift between all three at the same time, much like their famed cloud fortresses. As such, it can be exceedinly difficult to correctly harvest any of it, but a successful batch can make for miraculous alchemy. Requires enchanted vial.
fire-giant	Fire Giant	10	Lock of Fire Giant Hair	55 gp	10 lb.			55	10	1		Resembling sparking embers, the hair of a fire giant is considered a valuable resource by blacksmiths. Striking the hairs creates a flame similar to a flint, while burning them creates a hotter flame than is achievable by most other fuels.
fire-giant	Fire Giant	15	Fire Giant Fingernail	185 gp	2 lb.	Potion of Giant Strength (Fire)		185	2	1		Like all giants, the fingernail of the fire giant is a key component in brewing the ubiquitous potion of giant strength. Despite the misconception among adventurers who believe that felling one giant can supply them potions for life, only one potion can be brewed per giant. This is because the alchemical process uses the fingernail as a channeling foci to summon that particular giant's strength and thus renders any other attempts moot.
fire-giant	Fire Giant	20	Fire Giant Heart	500 gp	5 lb.	Living Lamp		500	5	1		Fire giants are known to literally have fire in their veins. One look at their hearts will make that obvious as they continue to spark and smoulder long after removal from their owner's body. Blacksmiths have long known how to transform these hearts into useful lamps.
frost-giant	Frost Giant	10	Lock of Frost Giant Hair	35 gp	10 lb.			35	10	1		Resembling the frost of an early morning, the hair of a frost giant is considered a valuable resource by hunters and explorers. The hair of a frost giant remains supernaturally cold in most climates even long after the giant's death. Packing perishables in a bag lined with frost giant hair is a good method to preserve them when no other option is available.
frost-giant	Frost Giant	15	Frost Giant Fingernail	135 gp	2 lb.	Potion of Giant Strength (Frost)		135	2	1		Like all giants, the fingernail of the frost giant is a key component in brewing the ubiquitous potion of giant strength. Despite the misconception among adventurers who believe that felling one giant can supply them potions for life, only one potion can be brewed per giant. This is because the alchemical process uses the fingernail as a channeling foci to summon that particular giant's strength and thus renders any other attempts moot.
frost-giant	Frost Giant	20	Frost Giant Tongue	425 gp	3 lb.	Bag of Colding		425	3	1		"The tongue of a frost giant is remarkably sensitive, coming from a creature so fierce. Unable to stand temperatures that could barely be considered ""warm"" to most humanoids, these tongues have been adapted for a variety of tools, including the bag of colding."
hill-giant	Hill Giant	10	Lock of Hill Giant Hair	20 gp	10 lb.			20	10	1		Resembling the brush on the top of a barren hill, the hair of a hill giant is considered a valuable resource to leatherworkers. The hair of a hill giant, while unpleasent to the touch, makes for a good rope material and even the hill giants themselves use it to stitch their clothes together.
hill-giant	Hill Giant	15	Hill Giant Fingernail	30 gp	2 lb.	Potion of Giant Strength (Hill)		30	2	1		Like all giants, the fingernail of the hill giant is a key component in brewing the ubiquitous potion of giant stength. Despite the misconception among adventurers who believe that felling one giant can supply them potions for life, only one potion can be brewed per giant. This is because the alchemical process uses the fingernail as a channeling foci to summon that particular giant's strength and thus renders any other attempts moot.
stone-giant	Stone Giant	10	Lock of Stone Giant Hair	30 gp	5 lb.			30	5	1		Resembling a patch of briar covering a boulder, the hair of a stone giant is considered a valuable resource to stoneworkers. Incredibly rough and bristly, this hair can be used to sand down stone. Getting a sizeable amount from the usually hairless stone giant however can prove to be a challenge in and of itself.
stone-giant	Stone Giant	15	Stone Giant Fingernail	135 gp	2 lb.	Potion of Giant Strength (Stone)		135	2	1		Like all giants, the fingernail of the stone giant is a key component in brewing the ubiquitous potion of giant strength. Despite the misconception among adventurers who believe that felling one giant can supply them potions for life, only one potion can be brewed per giant. This is because the alchemical process uses the fingernail as a channeling foci to summon that particular giant's strength and thus renders any other attempts moot.
stone-giant	Stone Giant	20	Stone Giant Molar	400 gp	7 lb.	Stone Anvil		400	7	1		The teeth of a stone giant are harder and denser than even the oldest of boulders. Their molars in particular have been noted to be particularly useful for stonemasons that wish to emulate the legendary crafting of the stone giants. In fact, some aging stone giants have even been known to gift their loose teeth to smallfolk they have grown fond of, in the hopes that they use them to carry on their legacy.
storm-giant	Storm Giant	10	Lock of Storm Giant Hair	150 gp	10 lb.			150	10	1		Resembling sparks running over a field in a storm, the hair of a storm giant is considered a valuable resource to artificers. Still containing remants of power from their original hosts, these hairs are often used as catalysts when performing the intricate spellwork required in crafting magical items.
storm-giant	Storm Giant	15	Storm Giant Fingernail	350 gp	2 lb.	Potion of Giant Strength (Storm)		350	2	1		Like all giants, the fingernail of the storm giant is a key component in brewing the ubiquitous potion of giant strength. Despite the misconception among adventurers who believe that felling one giant can supply them potions for life, only one potion can be brewed per giant. This is because the alchemical process uses the fingernail as a channeling foci to summon that particular giant's strength and thus renders any other attempts moot.
storm-giant	Storm Giant	20	Storm Giant Spine	900 gp	80 lb.	Storm Pole		900	80	1		Lightning courses through every fibre of a storm giant's being, but nowhere is this more pronounced than their spinal columns. A few choice vertebrae can create a powerful tool that would make a great addition to any laboratory.
gibbering-mouther	Gibbering Mouther	10	Gibbering Mouther Teeth (small pouch)	1 gp	8 lb.	Living Dentures		1	8	1		The assorted teeth of the gibbering mouther is a literal mixed bag of tusks, fangs, and chompers from all the creatures that the mouther has devoured. These teeth hold little value above what a normal set of teeth would fetch, but some people with interest in aberrants collect these out of a morbid curiosity.
gibbering-mouther	Gibbering Mouther	15	Mouther Spittle	10 gp	2 lb.		vial	10	2	1	 (vial)	The spittle of the gibbering mouther is a bizarre melange of the digestive enzymes of every single creature that it has devoured. By a cruel act of nature, this hazardous mixture reacts with air and can subsequently blind any creature unlucky enough to be caught in its radius. Use: Can be thrown at a point within 15 feet, with the vial exploding on impact. All creatures within 5 feet of the explosion must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be blinded until the users next turn.
githyanki-warrior	Githyanki Warrior	15	Githyanki Heart	5 gp	1 lb.			5	1	1		The githyanki are not originally a species native to the Astral Plane, and yet they have made it their home regardless. Prolonged exposures to the unaging nature of the Astral Plane has caused some of their organs, particularly their hearts, to develop curious qualities that are valuable to scholars attempting to unlock the secrets of that place.
githyanki-warrior	Githyanki Warrior	20	Githyanki Brain	10 gp	4 lb.			10	4	1		The githyanki brain is a marvel of biology. Capable of psionic output powerful enough to bend the normal laws of physics, it is noticebly larger and more developed than most other humanoid's. Although doing so may be distasteful for civilised folk, consuming the brain of a githyanki can temporarily boost the latent psionic powers of other humanoids, granting them similar abilities to its previous owner. Use: As an action, you may consume the githyanki brain. For the next hour, you may cast the mage hand spell as a cantrip, as well as cast the jump spell up to 3 times.
githyanki-knight	Githyanki Knight	10	Githyanki Hair Braid	20 gp	1 lb.			20	1	1		The hair braid of a mighty githyanki warrior is a symbol of their prowess in combat. An intact braid can fetch a tidy sum among collectors back on the Material Plane.
githyanki-knight	Githyanki Knight	15	Githyanki Heart	5 gp	1 lb.			5	1	1		The githyanki are not originally a species native to the Astral Plane, and yet they have made it their home regardless.

Although doing so may be distasteful for civilised folk, consuming the brain of a githyanki can temporarily boost the latent psionic powers of other humanoids, granting them similar abilities to its previous owner. Use: As an action, you may consume the githyanki brain. For the next hour, you may cast the mage hand spell as a cantrip, as well as cast the jump spell up to 3 times.
githzerai-monk	Githzerai Monk	15	Githzerai Heart	5 gp	1 lb.			5	1	1		The githyanki are not originally a species native to Limbo, and yet they have made it their home regardless. Their existence there is a paradox; a stretch of serenity in an otherwise chaotic sea. This is reflected in their own bodies which have gradually adapted to living in such a place. Their hearts in particular are noteworthy to scholars trying to unlock the power of that plane.
githzerai-monk	Githzerai Monk	20	Githzerai Brain	10 gp	4 lb.			10	4	1		The githzerai brain is a marvel of biology. Capable of psionic output powerful enough to bend the normal laws of physics, it is noticebly larger and more developed than most other humanoid's. Although doing so may be distasteful for civilised folk, consuming the brain of a githzerai can temporarily boost the latent psionic powers of other humanoids, granting them similar abilities to its previous owner. Use: As an action, you may consume the githzerai brain. For the next hour, you may cast the mage hand spell as a cantrip, as well as cast the feather fall spell up to 3 times.
githzerai-zerth	Githzerai Zerth	10	Githzerai Brand	20 gp	1 lb.			20	1	1		The githzerai practice many rituals in their constant adherence to discipline and tradition. One of these is a ritualistic branding of their bodies. Each brand may only be earned after the githzerai have demonstrated a mastery of a skill respected within the githzerai culture. Young and novice githzerai may only have a simple brand of a single skill, while the most revered and experienced in their society would have intricate brands, developed and layered on each other over their many years of learning. These brands are both rare and beautiful to admire, making them valuable to collectors elsewhere.
githzerai-zerth	Githzerai Zerth	15	Githzerai Heart	5 gp	1 lb.			5	1	1		The githyanki are not originally a species native to Limbo, and yet they have made it their home regardless.

gnoll	Gnoll	10	Gnoll Tooth (small pouch)	1 sp	1 lb.			0.1	1	1		The sharp, irregular teeth of a gnoll. Not worth much other than as a trophy. Harvesters are advised to wash them at the first chance, as they carry the stench of a gnoll's mouth long after removal.
gnoll-pack-lord	Gnoll Pack Lord	10	Gnoll Tooth (small pouch)	1 sp	1 lb.			0.1	1	1		The sharp, irregular teeth of a gnoll. Not worth much other than as a trophy. Harvesters are advised to wash them at the first chance, as they carry the stench of a gnoll's mouth long after removal.
gnoll-pack-lord	Gnoll Pack Lord	15	Mark of Yeenoghu	1 gp	1 lb.			1	1	1		As an homage to their demonic overlord, particularly zealous gnolls paint themselves with the mark of Yeenoghu using the blood of their victims. The brands have little of their intended effect of making the gnoll invulnerable, but mostly just due to the gnoll's own incompetence. The marks themselves actually do possess a degree of magic that demonologists value as a research material and component.
gnoll-fang-of-yeenoghu	Gnoll Fang of Yeenoghu	10	Gnoll Tooth (small pouch)	1 sp	1 lb.			0.1	1	1		The sharp, irregular teeth of a gnoll. Not worth much other than as a trophy. Harvesters are advised to wash them at the first chance, as they carry the stench of a gnoll's mouth long after removal.
gnoll-fang-of-yeenoghu	Gnoll Fang of Yeenoghu	15	Mark of Yeenoghu	1 gp	1 lb.			1	1	1		As an homage to their demonic overlord, particularly zealous gnolls paint themselves with the mark of Yeenoghu using the blood of their victims. The brands have little of their intended effect of making the gnoll invulnerable, but mostly just due to the gnoll's own incompetence. The marks themselves actually do possess a degree of magic that demonologists value as a research material and component.
gnoll-fang-of-yeenoghu	Gnoll Fang of Yeenoghu	20	Demon Gnoll Heart	10 gp	2 lb.	Yeenoghu's Boon		10	2	1		After a fang of Yeenoghu is killed, the demonic spirit that empowered it leaves. However, its corrupting touch lingers on the corpse long after its death. This is most obvious in the heart of a slain fang of Yeenoghu which continues to drip a drool-like ichor even after removal from the body.
gnome-deep	Gnome, Deep	10	Deep Gnome Hide	1 gp	10 lb.			1	10	1		The skin of the cavern dwelling gnomish subrace is a distinctive ashy-grey in colour and has adapted over millenia to a subterranean lifestyle. As such, it can be fashioned into a good cloak that provides ample camouflage when spelunking. I wouldn't recommend wearing it around civilised society however.
goblin	Goblin	5	Goblin Ear	5 cp	1 lb.			0.05	1	2	 (x2)	Goblins neither possess much of value, nor are made of anything of value. Goblin ears are perhaps the only thing worth carving off of an average goblin, if only because dogs enjoy snacking on them the same way they enjoy pig ears.
goblin-boss	Goblin Boss	5	Goblin Ear	5 cp	1 lb.			0.05	1	2	 (x2)	Goblins neither possess much of value, nor are made of anything of value. Goblin ears are perhaps the only thing worth carving off of an average goblin, if only because dogs enjoy snacking on them the same way they enjoy pig ears.
clay-golem	Clay Golem	10	Golem Core	20 gp	10 lb.			20	10	1		When a golem is created, a spirit from the Elemental Plane of Earth is summoned to animate it. This spirit operates from a core of material at the very centre of the golem's mass. After a golem is defeated, this core remains and can be very useful for artificers looking to animate their own creations.
clay-golem	Clay Golem	15	Clay Golem Clay	150 gp	30 lb.	Clay Weapon		150	30	1		While a defeated clay golem loses much of its magical properties, it maintains a supernatural durability above that of regular clay. Resculpting this into other forms can create a very formidable weapon or armour. 
clay-golem	Clay Golem	20	Manual Ashes (small pouch)	500 gp	1 lb.	Golem Companion		500	1	1		The final step of creating a new golem is to sprinkle the ashes of manual of golem creation over the inanimate body. Some of these these ashes become stuck to the freshly made body and can be recovered. Of course, such a small amount would not be able to animate a full body, but can be used to animate a much smaller creation.
flesh-golem	Flesh Golem	10	Golem Core	15 gp	10 lb.			15	10	1		When a golem is created, a spirit from the Elemental Plane of Earth is summoned to animate it. This spirit operates from a core of material at the very centre of the golem's mass. After a golem is defeated, this core remains and can be very useful for artificers looking to animate their own creations.
flesh-golem	Flesh Golem	15	Flesh Golem Meat	30 gp	10 lb.			30	10	1		The reanimation of deceased flesh into a golem's form permanently affects its structure and composition. The resulting meat is said to cause brief but violent outbursts in those that consume it. Use: If at least 1 pound of flesh golem meat is consumed, whether raw or cooked, the eater enters a berserker rage. On each of its turns while berserk, the golem attacks the nearest creature it can see. If no creature is near enough to move to and attack, the eater attacks an object, with preference for an object smaller than itself. This effect lasts for 1 minute, or until a creature that the eater trusts succeeds on a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check to calm them.
flesh-golem	Flesh Golem	20	Manual Ashes (small pouch)	140 gp	1 lb.	Golem Companion		140	1	1		The final step of creating a new golem is to sprinkle the ashes of manual of golem creation over the inanimate body. Some of these these ashes become stuck to the freshly made body and can be recovered. Of course, such a small amount would not be able to animate a full body, but can be used to animate a much smaller creation.
iron-golem	Iron Golem	10	Golem Core	30 gp	10 lb.			30	10	1		When a golem is created, a spirit from the Elemental Plane of Earth is summoned to animate it. This spirit operates from a core of material at the very centre of the golem's mass. After a golem is defeated, this core remains and can be very useful for artificers looking to animate their own creations.
iron-golem	Iron Golem	15	Poison Canister	1,100 gp	7 lb.	Poison Lung		1100	7	1		"Inside an iron golem's chest cavity is a secret compartment lined with a slightly different iron alloy to the rest of the golem. This alloy reacts with oxygen to create a poisonous gas that the iron golem seemingly ""breathes"" at its enemies. If harvested correctly, it can be repaired by a skilled tinker into your own poisonous device."
iron-golem	Iron Golem	20	Iron Golem Iron	2,000 gp	60 lb.	Plate Armour, + 3 (DMG) or Shield, + 3 (DMG)		2000	60	1		The metal used to craft an iron golem is leagues better than what you would find in an average alley blacksmith's shop. Taking this metal and resmelting it can craft some of the finest armour in the land.
iron-golem	Iron Golem	20	Manual Ashes (small pouch)	2,000 gp	1 lb.	Golem Companion		2000	1	1		The final step of creating a new golem is to sprinkle the ashes of manual of golem creation over the inanimate body. Some of these these ashes become stuck to the freshly made body and can be recovered. Of course, such a small amount would not be able to animate a full body, but can be used to animate a much smaller creation.
stone-golem	Stone Golem	10	Golem Core	20 gp	10 lb.			20	10	1		When a golem is created, a spirit from the Elemental Plane of Earth is summoned to animate it. This spirit operates from a core of material at the very centre of the golem's mass. After a golem is defeated, this core remains and can be very useful for artificers looking to animate their own creations.
stone-golem	Stone Golem	15	Golem Stone	300 gp	25 lb.	Breastplate, + 2		300	25	1		Although a stone golem may be defeated, it leaves behind a permanent change to the composition of the stone it was formed from. While still very durable, this stone has a certain flexibility and lightness to it that is unmatched by anything found in nature. This property allows for the crafting of certain items that would otherwise be unfeasible with regular stone. 
stone-golem	Stone Golem	20	Manual Ashes (small pouch)	700 gp	1 lb.	Golem Companion		700	1	1		The final step of creating a new golem is to sprinkle the ashes of manual of golem creation over the inanimate body. Some of these these ashes become stuck to the freshly made body and can be recovered. Of course, such a small amount would not be able to animate a full body, but can be used to animate a much smaller creation.
gorgon	Gorgon	10	Gorgon Oil	2 gp	1 lb.		vial	2	1	5	 (5 vials)	The naturally produced oil of the gorgon is a widely sought after lubricant. Crafters from all fields can find some use for it in their work and demand always exceeds supply.
gorgon	Gorgon	15	Gorgon Gas Sack (Only harvestable if the gorgon had its petrifying breath ability available upon death)	20 gp	5 lb.			20	5	1		The gas gland of a gorgon, located just behind its nasal cavity. Resembles a balloon if it were made from metal foil. When harvested, can be given a good squeeze to produce the same petrifying effect its owner once used. Use: As an action you may squeeze the sack and release a petrifying gas in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a target begins to turn to stone and is restrained. The restrained target must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effects ends on the target. On a failure, the target is petrified until freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic. Once used, the sack is emptied and becomes useless.
gorgon	Gorgon	15	Gorgon Hoof	20 gp	25 lb.	Greatclub, +1 (DMG) Maul, +1 (DMG) or Warhammer, + 1 (DMG)		20	25	4	 (x4)	The hooves of a gorgon resemble anvils more than anything else. It is ironic then that these are often reforged by blacksmiths on their own anvils.
gorgon	Gorgon	20	Gorgon Horn	20 gp	20 lb.	Lance, +1 (DMG) Trident, +1 (DMG) War pick, +1 (DMG) Javelin, +1 (DMG) or Spear, +1 (DMG)		20	20	2	 (x2)	It is hard to decide whether it is preferable to die by the hooves or the horn of a gorgon. Either way, a successfully harvested gorgon horn can be refined by any skilled blacksmith into a formidable weapon.
gorgon	Gorgon	20	Gorgon Plate	30 gp	60 lb.	Any heavy armour or shield, + 1 (DMG)		30	60	1		The iron-like armour plating of a gorgon is incredibly hard and yet is supple and breathes like skin. It is thus a unique and useful material for making fine armours.
grell	Grell	10	Grell Tentacle	3 gp	5 lb.	Whip, +1 (DMG)		3	5	2	 (x2)	The formidable tentacles of a grell make fine whips once they are removed, dried, treated and fitted with a handle. Many Underdark societies have been seen using whips made from grells, for both their strength and their intimidation factor.
grell	Grell	15	Grell Poison	30 gp	1 lb.		vial	30	1	1	 (vial)	A grell's poison is known to paralyse hapless victims, leaving them helpless as the grell flies away with them to be devoured. By removing the gland located where its tentacles meet its body, this poison can be extracted and used against one's own enemies. Use: Can be used to coat up to 5 pieces of slashing or piercing ammunition or one slashing or piercing weapon. Applying the poison takes 1 minute. For the next minute, any creature successfully hit must succed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned. The poisoned target is paralyzed, and it can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.
grell	Grell	20	Grell Hide	40 gp	8 lb.	Grell Jerkin		40	8	1		The hide of a grell is extremely sensitve to certain stimuli that completely bypasses the sense of most humanoids. Extremely difficult to remove intact, this hide can be used to craft armours that grant its wearer a sixth-sense similar to the grell's own.
grick	Grick	10	Grick Tentacle	1 gp	6 lb.			1	6	4	 (x4)	The deadly tentacle of a grick is both rubbery and sharp. However, after prolonged tenderising, boiling, and seasoning, these tentacles make for a delicacy that several Underdark races have come to enjoy. It is usually served with a sauce reduced from the grick's own blood. It is an acquired taste to say the least.
grick	Grick	15	Grick Hide	10 gp	18 lb.	Grick Hide Cloak		10	18	1		The skin of a grick has a unique shade and hue that allows it to blend into its rocky surroundings with ease. While difficult to remove properly from its rubbery carcass, the resulting hide makes for good camouflage clothes.
alpha-grick	Alpha Grick	10	Alpha Grick Tentacle	1 gp	10 lb.			1	10	4	 (x4)	The deadly tentacle of a grick is both rubbery and sharp. However, after prolonged tenderising, boiling, and seasoning, these tentacles make for a delicacy that several Underdark races have come to enjoy. It is usually served with a sauce reduced from the grick's own blood. It is an acquired taste to say the least.
alpha-grick	Alpha Grick	15	Alpha Grick Hide	25 gp	22 lb.	Grick Hide Cloak		25	22	1		The skin of a grick has a unique shade and hue that allows it to blend into its rocky surroundings with ease. While difficult to remove properly from its rubbery carcass, the resulting hide makes for good camouflage clothes.
alpha-grick	Alpha Grick	20	Grick Pearl	185 gp	5 lb.	Gem of the Underdark		185	5	1		The grick that has become large enough to lead other gricks as an alpha is usually the one that has lived long enough to eat the most stuff. Because of the grick's voracious apetite and low intelligence, sometimes this stuff includes the treasures of the hapless victims that cross its path. In rare circumstances, these treasures can sit in the grick's digestive system for a prolonged time and form a pearl. This pearl resembles whatever mish mash of materials created it, but coated with what appears to be a supernaturally dark hue that never goes away despite the lighting. This pearl can be taken by artificers and crafted into an item that taps into its inherent connection to the Underdark.
griffon	Griffon	5	Griffon Talon	5 sp	20 lb.			0.5	20	2	 (x2)	The talons of a griffon contain a unique collagen in them that when rendered creates a high quality adhesive. This glue is prized by leatherworkers and most can never find enough to meet their demand.
griffon	Griffon	10	Griffon Feather	1 gp	1 lb.	Arrow +1 (DMG)		1	1	10	 (x10)	The pristine feathers of a griffon carry an almost supernatural aerodynamic quality to them. Fletchers and sharpshooters prize good condition griffon feathers for crafting high quality arrows.
griffon	Griffon	15	Griffon Eye	5 gp	1 lb.	Eye of the Eagle (DMG)		5	1	2	 (x2)	A griffon can spot prey while flying miles overhead, and spot potential rivals from great distances. Their magical eyes have long been used as as charms and medicines by mountainfolk, but the utilisation of their eyes has been perfected by artificers capable of turning them into an eyes of the eagle mask.
grimlock	Grimlock	20	Grimlock Brain	5 gp	4 lb.	Potion of Mind Flayer Resistance		5	4	1		Grimlocks are a pathetic race, descendent from humans craven enough to worship the illithid race as deities. That said, their wretchedness can still prove useful to the rest of us. Generations of exposure to the illithid's experiments and influence has produced a permanent physiological change in the brain of the grimlock that when brewed into a potion, can provide some level of immunity to the abilities of the mind flayers. 
green-hag	Green Hag	10	Green Hag Hair (small pouch)	1 gp	4 lb.			1	4	1		The hair of a green hag flows like rotten reeds at the bottom of a swamp. While unpleasant to both observe and to hold, it possesses some weak magical properties and is often used by seedier alchemists looking for cheap substitutes for higher quality ingredients.
green-hag	Green Hag	10	Hag Blood	3 gp	1 lb.		vial	3	1	3	 (3 vials)	Absolutely reeking of the foulness that permeated the hag's entire being, drinking this blood has the potential to infect a creature with crone's disease. It should also be noted that while the blood smells and tastes as fetid as it looks, alcohol has a neutralising effect on both of these properties. What someone does with that information is entirely out of this writer's control.
green-hag	Green Hag	15	Green Hag Skull	14 gp	10 lb.	Deception Skull		14	10	1		Green hags are notorious for their ability to mimic sounds to lure or scare intruders to their lairs. This ability lingers behind in their skulls and artificers can draw out this latent power to create a magical trinket with much of the same property. In several ways, the hag would probably have enjoyed the idea of its carcass being used for such a macabre activity. 
green-hag	Green Hag	20	Hag Eyeball	50 gp	1 lb.			50	1	1		"Not to be confused with the notorious ""hag eye"" amulet given by hags to their servants, however the two are tightly linked. Despite being severed from its socket, this eye still seems to glare as it did in life. Use: As an action you may concentrate on the hag eyeball while it is in your hand. While doing so, you may utilise that hag's hag eye that same way they would have used it in life. If the hag eye is destroyed while you are concentrating on the hag eyeball, you suffer 3d10 psychic damage and are blinded for 24 hours."
night-hag	Night Hag	10	Night Hag Hair (small pouch)	3 gp	4 lb.	Night Hag Dreamcatcher		3	4	1		As thick and dark as a suffocating night, night hag hair carries some of the magical properties once abused by its previous owner.
night-hag	Night Hag	10	Hag Blood	3 gp	1 lb.		vial	3	1	3	 (3 vials)	Absolutely reeking of the foulness that permeated the hag's entire being, drinking this blood has the potential to infect a creature with crone's disease. It should also be noted that while the blood smells and tastes as fetid as it looks, alcohol has a neutralising effect on both of these properties. What someone does with that information is entirely out of this writer's control.
night-hag	Night Hag	15	Night Hag Skull	25 gp	10 lb.	Nightmare Skull		25	10	1		The skull of the night hag continues to carry the same dark energies that it once held in life, corrupting mortals and driving them mad with nightmares.
night-hag	Night Hag	20	Hag Eyeball	50 gp	1 lb.			50	1	1		"Not to be confused with the notorious ""hag eye"" amulet given by hags to their servants, however the two are tightly linked. Despite being severed from its socket, this eye still seems to glare as it did in life. Use: As an action you may concentrate on the hag eyeball while it is in your hand. While doing so, you may utilise that hag's hag eye that same way they would have used it in life. If the hag eye is destroyed while you are concentrating on the hag eyeball, you suffer 3d10 psychic damage and are blinded for 24 hours."
sea-hag	Sea Hag	10	Sea Hag Hair (small pouch)	1 gp	2 lb.	Potion of Water Breathing (DMG)		1	2	1		Resembling rotten seaweed, the hair of a sea hag can be washed, sliced, dried, and then seeped for a prolonged time to create a potion of water breathing. It should be warned however that drinking a potion made from sea hag hair has the potential to infect a victim with crone's disease. 
sea-hag	Sea Hag	10	Hag Blood	3 gp	1 lb.		vial	3	1	3	 (3 vials)	Absolutely reeking of the foulness that permeated the hag's entire being, drinking this blood has the potential to infect a creature with crone's disease. It should also be noted that while the blood smells and tastes as fetid as it looks, alcohol has a neutralising effect on both of these properties. What someone does with that information is entirely out of this writer's control.
sea-hag	Sea Hag	15	Sea Hag Skull	15 gp	10 lb.	Fear Skull		15	10	1		While devoid of its characteristic facial features, the skull of the sea hag still carries a malevolent aura that chills any that gaze upon it.
sea-hag	Sea Hag	20	Hag Eyeball	50 gp	1 lb.			50	1	1		"Not to be confused with the notorious ""hag eye"" amulet given by hags to their servants, however the two are tightly linked. Despite being severed from its socket, this eye still seems to glare as it did in life. Use: As an action you may concentrate on the hag eyeball while it is in your hand. While doing so, you may utilise that hag's hag eye that same way they would have used it in life. If the hag eye is destroyed while you are concentrating on the hag eyeball, you suffer 3d10 psychic damage and are blinded for 24 hours."
half-dragon	Half Dragon	10	Half-Dragon Blood	8 gp	1 lb.		vial	8	1	3	 (3 vials)	While regular dragon blood is too foreign to have any effect on a humanoid without significant alteration, the diluted nature of a half-dragon's blood allows it to bestow significant benefits on a humanoid imbiber. Use: As an action you may drink the vial of half-dragon blood. For the next 10 minutes, you gain the same type of damage resistance of the half-dragon it was taken from.
half-dragon	Half Dragon	15	Half-Dragon Scales (small pouch)	60 gp	10 lb.	Dra-gone Paste/Drag-on Paste		60	10	1		Half-dragons occupy an odd position in the taxonomy of creatures. This is best reflected in the strange effect that their bodies have on the senses of real dragons around them. Their strange physiology seems to cause them to slip beneath the notice of dragons of their own colour, tricking them into thinking they are one of their own. Taking a half-dragon's scales, grinding them into a powder, and then mixing them with oil creates a paste that other humanoids can apply to their own bodies to avoid or promote detection by dragons.
harpy	Harpy	10	Harpy Feather (small pouch)	4 sp	1 lb.			0.4	1	1		Harpy feathers are notably large but of a fine quality, reflective of the harpies beuaitful but dangerous nature. Too large for fletching, they nonetheless make excellent quills.
harpy	Harpy	15	Harpy Vocal Cords	2 gp	2 lb.	Harpy Harp		2	2	1		If harpies are known for one thing, it is their singing. Their vocal cords are able to produce a wide variety of sounds, and some daring bards have taken to using them as strings for their instruments. Bards with instruments of the harpies are said to play music that can entrance entire rooms of listeners.
harpy	Harpy	20	Harpy Egg	8 gp	3 lb.	Harpy Ink		8	3	1		On a rare occasion, you may slay a harpy that was in the middle of ovulation. Whether the egg is fertilised is irrelevant, as it is the eggshell that holds the true value. When this pink-speckled shell is powdered, it makes a dye with potent magical abilities.
hell-hound	Hell Hound	5	Hell Hound Fur (3 tufts)	10 gp	2 lb.			10	2	1		When a hell hound dies, it is consumed by its internal fire leaving nothing behind but ash of burnt fur. While this is disapointing to harvesters, the fur still has some utility. Use: As an action, you may rub 1 tuft of hell hound fur into your hands. If you do so, for the next minute, whenever you roll a 1 or 2 on a fire damage dice roll, you may reroll that die and you must use the new number. After being used, the tuft of hell hound fur loses its magic and becomes useless.
helmed-horror	Helmed Horror	10	Helmed Horror Helmet	15 gp	8 lb.	Blinders Helm		15	8	1		When crafting a helmed horror, no ordinary helmet will do. One made specifically for the purpose must be comissioned in order to grant the unique senses that the helmed horror possesses. With some time, an artificer can take one of these helms and reconfigure the arcane signatures so that they work for regular humanoids.
helmed-horror	Helmed Horror	15	Helmed Horror Essence	60 gp	1 lb.		spirit paper	60	1	1		The animating spirit of a helmed horror dissipates quickly after its form loses structural integrity. If done quickly however, this spirit can be caught using a sheet of spirit paper. No matter how quick you may be however, some of the spirit will have degraded already, thus any attempt at reusing the spirit is sure to result in a lower quality construct than the original helmed horror. Requires spirit paper. Use: You may spend an hour performing a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check with the spirit paper to transfer the essence to an unworn suit of plate armour. If you are successful, the essence leaves the spirit paper and enters the suit of armour, creating an animated armour under your control. This armour follows your instructions to the best of its ability, but lacks the intelligenec to discern any nuance from your words and follows orders to the letter. This animated armour remains until it is destroyed.
hippogriff	Hippogriff	5	Hippogriff Hooves	4 sp	6 lb.			0.4	6	2	 (x2)	The hooves of a hippogriff contain a unique collagen in them that when rendered creates a high quality adhesive. This glue is prized by leatherworkers and most can never find enough to meet their demand.
hippogriff	Hippogriff	10	Hippogriff Feather	1 gp	1 lb.	Arrow, +1 (DMG)		1	1	10	 (x10)	The pristine feathers of a hippogriff carry an almost supernatural aerodynamic quality to them. Fletchers and sharpshooters prize good condition hippogriff feathers for fletching high quality arrows.
hippogriff	Hippogriff	15	Hippogriff Eye	5 gp	1 lb.	Eyes of the Eagle (DMG)		5	1	2	 (x2)	It is said that a hippogriff can spot a mouse in a field from more than 2 miles over. Whether true or not, they can definitely spot an orcish ambush coming from a few hundred feet out, and this is another reason that hippogriffs are so highly valued as mounts and companions.
hobgoblin	Hobgoblin	5	Hobgoblin Ear	2 sp	1 lb.			0.2	1	1		The body of a hobgoblin holds little practical use for harvesters. Most cities however will pay small bounties for hobgoblin ears,
hobgoblin-captain	Hobgoblin Captain	5	Hobgoblin Ear	2 sp	1 lb.			0.2	1	1		The body of a hobgoblin holds little practical use for harvesters. Most cities however will pay small bounties for hobgoblin ears.
hobgoblin-captain	Hobgoblin Captain	10	Hobgoblin War Braid	1 gp	1 lb.			1	1	1		As a hobgoblin grows in experience and prestige, they grow out their hair into braids that are only ever cut if they lose a battle. These braids hold some value to collectors as well as bounty offices as proof of felling a noteworthy hobgoblin threat.
hobgoblin-warlod	Hobgoblin Warlod	5	Hobgoblin Ear	2 sp	1 lb.			0.2	1	1		The body of a hobgoblin holds little practical use for harvesters. Most cities however will pay small bounties for hobgoblin ears.
hobgoblin-warlod	Hobgoblin Warlod	10	Hobgoblin War Braid	1 gp	1 lb.			1	1	1		As a hobgoblin grows in experience and prestige, they grow out their hair into braids that are only ever cut if they lose a battle. These braids hold some value to collectors as well as bounty offices as proof of felling a noteworthy hobgoblin threat.
hobgoblin-warlod	Hobgoblin Warlod	15	Mark of Maglubiyet	5 gp	2 lb.	Amulet of Maglubiyet		5	2	1		When a hobgoblin becomes powerful enough that they are considered a warlord, they receive a special mark to venerate themselves in the face of their deity: Maglubiyet. If skinned correctly and preserved, this mark can be taken by thaumaturges to craft a trinket imbued with the terrifying influence of the goblinoid god.
homunculus	Homunculus	10	Homunculus Material	40 gp	6 lb.			40	6	1		The destroyed body of a homunculus returns to its mundane components upon its death. These components can be recycled into a new homunculus.
homunculus	Homunculus	20	Homunculus Blood	Varies	2 lb.		enchanted vial	Varies	2	1	 (vial)	The homunculus' blood is the same as its master's: a wizard must bleed onto an empty construct in order to bring it to life. While this imparts a connection to that wizard that they would find useful, it can also be exploited by others skilled in the arcane arts who manage to capture said homunculus. As such, the price of this blood can vary wildly depending on which wizard's homunculus it was taken from. Requires enchanted vial. Use: As an action you may drink the homunculus blood. Doing so gives you all the knowledge that the homunculus had up to the point of its death, including the languages it knew, and the knowledge that its creator shared with it. You may not necessarily understand all of this knowledge, especially if it is of a very esoteric nature and you may not necessarily be able to parse all of it. You retain this knowledge for 10 minutes, after which all of it vanishes from your mind. Once this happens, you become stunned for 1 minute as your mind recovers from the influx of information it received.
hooked-horror	Hooked Horror	5	Hooked Horror Exoskeleton	4 gp	40 lb.			4	40	1		The hooked horror's exoskeleton is harder than iron, but unfortunately is difficult to reshape and thus unsuited for armour. However, it does have several other uses including being used as a sturdy container, building material, or even as using its reverberative nature as a percussion instrument. Many Underdark cultures thus value these exoskeletons when recovered in good condition.
hooked-horror	Hooked Horror	10	Hooked Horror Cochlea	10 gp	1 lb.	Shell of Hearing		10	1	1		The extremely sensitive cochlea of a hooked horror is not unlike that of a bat's. Capable of hearing both extreme distances and different wavelengths, this cochlea serves as a key component for various hearing aids and magical items.
hooked-horror	Hooked Horror	15	Hooked Horror Hook	10 gp	5 lb.	War Pick, +1 (DMG)		10	5	2	 (x2)	The eponymous hooks of the hooked horror. Formed of an extremely hard, yet yielding, keratin material. With slight modifications, these hooks can be turned into a formidable war pick that doubles as a climbing pick. 
hydra	Hydra	5	Hydra Scale (large bag)	15 gp	15 lb.			15	15	1		The scales of a hydra have a long history as art materials in coastal societies; hydras are known for shedding many scales throughout their lifetimes. Durable and of a unique hue, they lend an intimidating aesthetic that many tailors would be eager to get their hands on. 
hydra	Hydra	10	Hydra Blood	5 gp	1 lb.	Potion of Superior Healing (DMG)	vial	5	1	7	 (7 vials)	Hydras are well known for their regenerative abilities, a property that has not gone unnoticed by alchemists. In fact hydra blood is one of many potential catalysts when brewing the ubiquitous healing potion. The hydra's powerful blood is known for brewing notably potent mixtures.
hydra	Hydra	15	Hydra Tooth	3 gp	1 lb.	Arrow, +2 (DMG)		3	1	30	 (x30)	Incredibly sharp and incredibly numerous. Coastal societies have been known to craft deadly arrows and spearheads from the many teeth that hydras leave behind as they lose and grow new heads.
hydra	Hydra	15	Hydra Heart Piece	80 gp	10 lb.			80	10	1		An organ capable of scaling up blood circulation regardless of how many heads its body grows, the heart of a hydra is brimming with magical potential. In fact, the heart of a hydra is so powerful that consuming one can even regrow lost limbs. Use: It takes 10 minutes to consume enough hydra heart to have an effect. Once consumed, you regain all hit points as well as regrow any missing body parts. If a body part is regrown in this way, you feel an intense feeling of hunger and suffer 1 level of exhaustion until you consume at least 5 pounds of food. The hydra heart must be consumed within 24 hours upon the death of the hydra, otherwise it gives no effect.
hydra	Hydra	20	Hydra Spinal Cord	350 gp	20 lb.	Staff of Multiplied Recovery		350	20	1		A hydra's spine is a unique piece of biology, capable of adapting itself to more heads than it was originally suited for. Certain vertebrae in particular are noted for holding strong magic, and when used together can make a powerful healing staff.
intellect-devourer	Intellect Devourer	15	Brain Fluid	4 gp	1 lb.		vial	4	1	1	 (vial)	The fluid that oozes through an intellect devourer is not unlike the mucus secreted by their illithid masters. This fluid however has the unique ability to carry and pass on memories to those that consume it. Use: As an action you may drink a vial of brain fluid. If you do so you must make a DC 12 Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, you become stunned for 1 minute as your mind fails to process the information flooding through it. On a success, you learn the identity of who this intellect devourer used to be, as well as one key memory. The key memory is up to the discretion of the DM, but may be something that the intellect devourer knew in its original life, or something it has learned after becoming an intellect devourer.
intellect-devourer	Intellect Devourer	20	Living Brainstem	12 gp	6 lb.			12	6	1		Living is a strong word in this case. Used here, it really means that the brain still has some capacity for interaction and response to stimuli, due largely to the dark rituals used to transform it into an intellect devourer. While it would be much more merciful to put the brain out of its misery by destroying it entirely, it still offers some use for an adventurer with a strong stomach. Use: For 6 hours after an intellect devourer's death, its main brain continues to send weak signals of psionic wavelengths. When the brain is worn directly on top of a humanoid's head, that humanoid becomes immune to the detect sentience ability of intellect devourers. Instead, an intellect devourer that detects that humanoid will assume that humanoid is a host of a living intellect devourer and will treat them accordingly. However, an intellect devourer that can see without using its blindsight will still notice that a humanoid is wearing a brain on the top of their head and will also react accordingly.
invisible-stalker	Invisible Stalker	15	Mote of Air	100 gp	1 lb.	Elemental Gem (Blue Sapphire) (DMG)	enchanted vial	100	1	1		When an air elemental's summoned form is dispersed, it leaves behind small clumps of dust that continue to carry trace amounts of elemental energy. These need to be collected quickly in specialised containers to prevent further degredation. If collected properly, they can then be used to craft an elemental gem. Requires enchanted vial.
invisible-stalker	Invisible Stalker	20	Stalker's Compass	10 gp	1 lb.		enchanted vial	10	1	1		When an invisible stalker is defeated before it can fulfill its mission, a single wisp of a breeze remains that futiley attempts to make its way to its quarry. If this wisp is captured quickly and prevented from further degredation, it will continue indefinitely attempting to reach its quarry. Resourceful trackers mix small amounts of dye into this container to make a makeshift compass that will lead them to whatever the invisible stalker was originally trying to hunt. Requires enchanted vial.
jackalwere	Jackalwere	10	Jackalwere Eye	8 sp	2 lb.			0.8	2	2	 (x2)	The mesmerising eyes of a jackalwere are able to lure unwary travellers into a slumber, and many commonfolk that live in areas frequented by jackalweres make a habit of looking down when speaking to strangers. Use: If you cast the sleep spell you may use a jackalwere eye as a material component. If you do so, you roll an additional 1d8 when determining the amount of hit points affected. You may only use one jackalwere eye at a time, and once used, a jackelware eye loses its magic and becomes useless.
kenku	Kenku	5	Kenku Feather (small pouch)	8 cp	1 lb.			0.08	1	1		Seeing as how kenkus are unable to fly, their feathers are largely vestigial. Still, despite their often dirty nature, they make for good quills. In fact, a good way to spot a kenku forger is to look for one that has bald patches over their body.
kenku	Kenku	10	Kenku Voice Box	1 sp	2 lb.			0.1	2	1		Other than their propensity for thievery, kenku are known for their uncanny mimicry abilities. Indeed, a kenku's voicebox is one of the most complex and well developed among any humanoid, and particularly resourceful tinkers have figured out how to modify them into unique musical trinkets and instruments. It would be advised however to avoid anyone willing to indulge in such a macabre craft.
winged-kobold	Winged Kobold	5	Kobold Teeth (small pouch)	8 cp	3 lb.			0.08	3	1		Like a crocodile, kobolds continuously grow and lose teeth throughout their lives. As such, their jaws tend to be lined with razor sharp rows of fresh pearly-whites. Kobolds use these for tools and there is no reason why other races should refuse to do the same if the opportunity presented itself.
winged-kobold	Winged Kobold	10	Kobold Wing	1 sp	8 lb.			0.1	8	2	 (x2)	"On a rare occasion, a kobold is born with a pair of wings. While small and relatively weak, the canvas-like skin make for a comfortable connective material in leatherworking. Of course, most leatherworkers advertise it ""dragon flaps,"" since that has a nicer sound than ""dead kobold skin."""
kobold	Kobold	5	Kobold Teeth (small pouch)	8 cp	3 lb.			0.08	3	1		Like a crocodile, kobolds continuously grow and lose teeth throughout their lives. As such, their jaws tend to be lined with razor sharp rows of fresh pearly-whites. Kobolds use these for tools and there is no reason why other races should refuse to do the same if the opportunity presented itself.
kraken	Kraken	10	Kraken Blood	100 gp	1 lb.	Potion of the Sea	vial	100	1	9	 (9 vials)	If anything betrays the kraken's blasphemous nature, it is the vile ichor that it tries to pass off as blood. Reeking of rotten fish and feeling just as slimy, the kraken's blood nontheless is coveted by alchemists for its intense alchemical potential.
kraken	Kraken	10	Kraken Ink	150 gp	1 lb.	Kraken Paint	vial	150	1	6	 (6 vials)	The ink of the kraken is vastly different to that secreted by a mere octopus. With a darkness that seems to leech the light around it, and a chemical mixture venomous to most creatures, this ink naturally has been weaponised by intrepid alchemists.
kraken	Kraken	10	Kraken Tooth	100 gp	20 lb.	Kraken Bolt		100	20	10	 (x10)	"A kraken's tooth is hard and sharp enough to cleave right through the hull of a ship. With that in mind, they make fantastic heads for ballistae bolts and harpoons, and navies reserve their ""kraken bolts"" for only the flagship of their enemies."
kraken	Kraken	15	Kraken Hide	2,000 gp	20 lb.	Kraken Tunic		2000	20	1		A kraken's hide is at once tough and rubbery, capable of absorbing even magically imbued strikes with ease. Only the greatest of tanners are able to work with this hide, and only certain choice sections of it, but those who can are capable of crafting an extremely powerful set of clothes for the marining adventurer.
kraken	Kraken	20	Kraken Crown Scale	4,000 gp	10 lb.	Kraken Shield		4000	10	1		As both armies and gods can attest, the scales of a kraken are nigh unpenetrable, even with magically powered strikes. Particularly prized is the scale located on the crown of the kraken's head which is both incredibly hard and the easiest to work with. Removing them is incredibly difficult however, and takes no small amount of elbow grease. Once pried off, they may be recrafted into a special shield by a blacksmith that has reached the zenith of their craft.
kraken	Kraken	25	Kraken Eye x2	6,000 gp	30 lb.	Loupe of the Depths		6000	30	1		The kraken has most likely forgotten more than ordinary mortals will ever hope to learn. From its watery domains, it has scoured ocean caverns hiding mysteries and treasures that surface dwellers were never meant to see. By taking a kraken's eye and subjecting it to a number of arcane rituals, these secrets can be revealed to a mind capable of handling them.
kraken	Kraken	25	Kraken Heart	12,000 gp	100 lb.			12000	100	3	 (x3)	Not many are aware that a kraken possesses 3 hearts, each with a slightly different circulatory function. In artificing function however they all serve the same purpose. By transfiguring them into crystals, they can be placed around a certain perimeter to act as wards against disastrous environmental effects. Many of the oldest port cities owe their longevity to these wards, or they would have been swept away by the tides long ago. Use: An artificer may spend 1 year performing a daily ritual to transform a kraken heart into a large red crystal with the ability to dampen natural forces. When 3 of these crystals are placed within 5 miles of each other, the area enclosed by them always experiences fair weather. Rain in that area never results in flooding, and waves are magically prevented from washing past the perimeter of that area.
kraken	Kraken	30	Kraken Brain Stem	30,000 gp	20 lb.	Amulet of the Ocean Lord		30000	20	1		Like some cephalapods, the brain of a kraken is actually divided into several areas, particularly focused in their tentacles. In order to facilitate this odd physiology on such a large scale, the main brain of the kraken has a certain electromagnetic quality to it that not only allows it to control its massive body, but also influence sea creatures and the area around it. If the right areas are harvested, they make a powerful amulet that can mimic some of these abilities.
kuo-toa	Kuo-Toa	5	Kuo-Toa Teeth (small pouch)	8 cp	1 lb.			0.08	1	1		The bite of a kuo-toa is not particularly deadly to anything larger than a river fish. Their unique shape however lends them well to doubling as fishing hooks, and many anglers swear that their yields increase when using kuo-toa hooks.
kuo-toa	Kuo-Toa	10	Kuo-Toa Skin	1 sp	10 lb.			0.1	10	1		Kuo-toa skin is notoriously slippery, owing to a mucus that the kuo-toa produces at all times. Soaking a fresh skin in this mucus helps to create a waterproof, if disgusting, tarp.
kuo-toa	Kuo-Toa	15	Kuo-Toa Brain	8 sp	2 lb.	Potion of Sensing		0.8	2	1		The brain of the kuo-toa is one racked by madness as a result of generations of exposure to illithid domination. Placing this brain in a crucible, removing impurities, and then boiling with various compatible catalysts creates a potion that can grant a drinker some of the otherworldly senses of a kuo-toa.
kuo-toa-archpriest	Kuo-Toa Archpriest	5	Kuo-Toa Teeth (small pouch)	8 cp	1 lb.			0.08	1	1		The bite of a kuo-toa is not particularly deadly to anything larger than a river fish. Their unique shape however lends them well to doubling as fishing hooks, and many anglers swear that their yields increase when using kuo-toa hooks.
kuo-toa-archpriest	Kuo-Toa Archpriest	10	Kuo-Toa Skin	1 sp	10 lb.			0.1	10	1		Kuo-toa skin is notoriously slippery, owing to a mucus that the kuo-toa produces at all times. Soaking a fresh skin in this mucus helps to create a waterproof, if disgusting, tarp.
kuo-toa-archpriest	Kuo-Toa Archpriest	20	Kuo-Toa Archpriest Brain	3 gp	2 lb.	Potion of Magical Madness		3	2	1		A kuo-toa archpriest's brain has become noticably more mutated that allows it to both use and bestow spells upon others. This unique brain is both more fragile than a regular kuo-toa's but also more useful in alchemy.
kuo-toa-whip	Kuo-Toa Whip	5	Kuo-Toa Teeth (small pouch)	8 cp	1 lb.			0.08	1	1		The bite of a kuo-toa is not particularly deadly to anything larger than a river fish. Their unique shape however lends them well to doubling as fishing hooks, and many anglers swear that their yields increase when using kuo-toa hooks.
kuo-toa-whip	Kuo-Toa Whip	10	Kuo-Toa Skin	1 sp	10 lb.			0.1	10	1		Kuo-toa skin is notoriously slippery, owing to a mucus that the kuo-toa produces at all times. Soaking a fresh skin in this mucus helps to create a waterproof, if disgusting, tarp.
kuo-toa-whip	Kuo-Toa Whip	15	Kuo-Toa Brain	8 sp	2 lb.	Potion of Sensing		0.8	2	1		The brain of the kuo-toa is one racked by madness as a result of generations of exposure to illithid domination. Placing this brain in a crucible, removing impurities, and then boiling with various compatible catalysts creates a potion that can grant a drinker some of the otherworldly senses of a kuo-toa.
lamia-br-	Lamia	10	Lamia Blood	2 gp	1 lb.	Philter of Love (DMG)	vial	2	1	5	 (5 vials)	As servants of Graz'zt, lamias are the living embodiment of charm and lust. Their blood reflects this and is one of many potential catalysts used when brewing the dreaded philter of love.
lamia-br-	Lamia	15	Lamia Claw	15 gp	9 lb.	Charming Knife		15	9	2	 (x2)	Those that have felt the gentle caress of a lamia know that there is a powerful magic imbued in their limbs. With some careful crafting, this magic can be harnessed into a weapon even beyond the death of its original owner.
lamia-br-	Lamia	20	Lamia Eye	40 gp	1 lb.	Lenses of the Oasis		40	1	2	 (x2)	Lamias treasure beauty above all else, going so far as casting illusions on their own realms to increase their aesthetic appeal. These visions of beauty are so persistent, that even after death, they remain in the lamia's eyes, waiting for an artificer to coax them out again.
lich	Lich	5	Lich Dust	3,000 gp	3 lb.	Lich Censer		3000	3	1		A lich's body is as much a part of it as a strand of hair on a normal human. It holds no significant connection to it, and discards it with little fanfare. This is because the lich's true power is located within its phylactery, its body acting as little more than a physical conduit for its actions. When a lich is defeated however, not all of its wicked spirit dissipates immediately. Quick action and powerful magic can bind the errant wisps of a lich's essence, allowing one to craft a trinket to track the lich wherever they may reform.
lizardfolk	Lizardfolk	5	Lizardfolk Teeth (small pouch)	8 cp	1 lb.			0.08	1	1		Like an alligator, lizardfolk continuously grow and lose teeth over time. They are not above turning these useful pieces of ivory into tools and weaponry, and indeed, there is no reason why the rest of us shouldn't either.
lizardfolk	Lizardfolk	10	Lizardfolk Hide	1 gp	15 lb.	Studded Leather Armour (DMG)		1	15	1		Lizardfolk hide is already about as strong as leather and can withstand cuts and blows that most humanoids would find lethal. These hides can be tanned just like any other reptiles, with the added advantage that it is already in the right configuration for a humanoid to wear.
lizardfolk-shaman	Lizardfolk Shaman	5	Lizardfolk Teeth (small pouch)	8 cp	1 lb.			0.08	1	1		Like an alligator, lizardfolk continuously grow and lose teeth over time. They are not above turning these useful pieces of ivory into tools and weaponry, and indeed, there is no reason why the rest of us shouldn't either.
lizardfolk-shaman	Lizardfolk Shaman	10	Lizardfolk Hide	1 gp	15 lb.	Studded Leather Armour (DMG) 		1	15	1		Lizardfolk hide is already about as strong as leather and can withstand cuts and blows that most humanoids would find lethal. These hides can be tanned just like any other reptiles, with the added advantage that it is already in the right configuration for a humanoid to wear.
lizardfolk-shaman	Lizardfolk Shaman	15	Shamanic Ridge	6 gp	10 lb.			6	10	1		The shamans of a lizardfolk tribe are easy to spot. They sport a distinctive spiked ridge starting from the crown of their skull down to the base of their tail. This ridge is considered to be a gift from their god, and is the source of their shamanic powers. Use: As an action, you may invoke the powers within this ridge to cast the polymorph spell on yourself. The animal form you choose when casting polymorph in this way must be a crocodile. Once used, this item loses its magical properties and becomes effectively useless.
lizardfolk-king-queen	Lizardfolk King/Queen	5	Lizardfolk Teeth (small pouch)	8 cp	1 lb.			0.08	1	1		Like an alligator, lizardfolk continuously grow and lose teeth over time. They are not above turning these useful pieces of ivory into tools and weaponry, and indeed, there is no reason why the rest of us shouldn't either.
lizardfolk-king-queen	Lizardfolk King/Queen	10	Lizardfolk Hide	1 gp	15 lb.	Studded Leather Armour (DMG) 		1	15	1		Lizardfolk hide is already about as strong as leather and can withstand cuts and blows that most humanoids would find lethal. These hides can be tanned just like any other reptiles, with the added advantage that it is already in the right configuration for a humanoid to wear.
lizardfolk-king-queen	Lizardfolk King/Queen	15	Semunaya's Boon	20 gp	4 lb.			20	4	1		The heart of a lizardfolk touched by Sess'Inek is as fetid and rotten as the swamp its owner lives in. This black organ pumps a stinking ichor through a lizardfolk's body, making them stronger and more vicious than its brethren. Eating it can bestow a temporary boon to a normal humanoid, but it is advised only to those with a strong will. Use: As an action, you may eat this item. Upon doing so, you gain the following abilities for the next hour: you are able to hold your breath for 15 minutes, you are immune to the frightened condition, your AC raises to 15 if it was lower than that as your skin becomes scaly, and once per turn, you may deal an extra 3d6 damage on a successful melee weapon attack, and gain temporary hit points equal to the extra damage dealt. Upon eating this item, you must also succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become berserk. While berserk, you must attempt to make a melee weapon attack against the closest creature to you, and/or move as close to them as possible. You remain berserk until the rest of the effects of eating this item also end.
lycanthropes	Lycanthropes	15	Lycanthrope Blood	10 gp	1 lb.	Moon Muzzle Mixture or Lycan Gas	vial	10	1	3	 (3 vials)	Their cursed blood is the one constant that all lycanthropes share regardless of were-shape or original species. Both feared and revered in equal measure, the blood of a lycanthrope is not to be treated carelessly. In the hands of a skilled alchemist, it can be used to dampen the worst side effects of lycanthropy, or spread its contagion even further. Use: As an action, you may drink the vial of lycanthrope blood and infect yourself with lycanthropy. The effect is the same as if you were bitten by a lycanthrope of the same type as that you took the blood from. For more information, refer to page 207 of the Monster Manual.
magmin	Magmin	5	Magma Shell	3 sp	15 lb.	Magmin Pan		0.3	15	1		The leftover shell of a magmin, composed of hard magma. It is quite hard and has impressive insulation qualities that allowed it to house a destructive fire elemental. These shells make for useful tools in alchemy, and it is not uncommon for wizards to summon these creatures just to harvest their shells.
magmin	Magmin	10	Mote of Fire	5 gp	1 lb.	Elemental Gem (Red Corundum) (DMG)	enchanted vial	5	1	1		When a fire elemental's summoned form is dispersed, it leaves behind small embers that continue to carry trace amounts of elemental energy. These need to be collected quickly in specialised containers to prevent further degredation. If collected properly, they can then be used to craft an elemental gem. Requires enchanted vial.
manticore	Manticore	10	Manticore Teeth (small pouch)	1 gp	4 lb.			1	4	1		While a manticore's mouth may resemble a human's, its teeth do not. Displayed in rows of jagged viciousness, these teeth are prized as trophies for their intimidating nature.
manticore	Manticore	15	Manticore Tail	10 gp	12 lb.	Whip +1 (DMG)		10	12	1		Of all the natural weapons that a manticore possesses, its tail is probably its most feared. Many mountain expeditions have ended with its members impaled by dozens of razor sharp spikes.
manticore	Manticore	20	Manticore Wing	40 gp	35 lb.	Manticore Cloak		40	35	2	 (x2)	The powerful wings of a manticore create a distinctive sillhouette in the sky that many mountaineers dread. The inherent flight magic held in the leather of these wings can be used to craft a useful cloak.
medusa	Medusa	10	Medusa Hair (bundle)	25 gp	10 lb.	Medusa Whip		25	10	1		The living snakes of a medusa die once their host does. Harvesting them intact, however, can make for very dangerous whip tails that deliver deadly poisons with each lash.
medusa	Medusa	15	Medusa Heart	50 gp	3 lb.	Curse of Vanity		50	3	1		The heart of a medusa is a sad one. Cursed by their own vanity, a sense of loneliness and regret seems to seep from these hearts. When used in a dark ritual, these hearts can serve as the core reagent for cursing an item with the same uncontrollable vanity of its original host.
medusa	Medusa	20	Medusa Head	130 gp	10 lb.	Medusa Helm		130	10	1		The notorious visage of a medusa transforms any creature that gazes upon it to stone. This property persists even into its death, and unfortunate adventurers can find themselves accidentally petrified when they go to inspect their kill. Even though the idea may be macabre, the preserved head of a medusa can be attached to equipment to petrify any that gaze upon it. Use: The head of the medusa carries the same petrifying gaze ability as listed in the statblock of the medusa, with the exception that the head cannot petrify itself.
mephit	Mephit	5	Mote of Dual Nature	1 gp	1 lb.		enchanted vial	1	1	1		When a mephit dies, it explodes into a cloud of its base material. If quickly harvested and kept, samples of these base materials can be preserved and used in alchemical mixtures. It is not uncommon for an alchemist's assistant to spend their day summoning and harvesting mephits just to restock their master's supplies. Requires enchanted vial.
merfolk	Merfolk	10	Merfolk Scales (small pouch)	5 sp	4 lb.			0.5	4	1		Merfolks come in just about any shade and colour imaginable, a fact that has not been lost on unscrupulous merchants. If you have the stomach for it (or have just found a merfolk that deserved it), a merfolk can be stripped of their scales for resale to surface dwelling tailors and dyers.
merrow	Merrow	5	Merrow Scales (small pouch)	5 sp	6 lb.			0.5	6	1		The scales of a merrow are not as vibrant as those of their merfolk ancestors. They do however still hold some use when ground down for the creation of dyes, and dye factories on the surface will pay a decent sum to get their hands on them.
merrow	Merrow	5	Merrow Blood	1 gp	1 lb.	Potion of Water Breathing (DMG)	vial	1	1	3	 (3 vials)	Compared to regular merfolk, the transformed nature of the merrow makes their blood more useful when used in alchemy. One of the most common uses of their blood is for the ubiquitous potion of water breathing. Ironically, a failed merrow assault can lead to survivors using their blood as a means to go back and hunt their attackers in their own domain.
merrow	Merrow	10	Merrow Claw	3 gp	10 lb.	Trident, +1 (DMG)		3	10	2	 (x2)	The claws of a merrow are capable of cleaving through flesh and bone and are a merrow's preferred method of attack. When preserved and reinforced, they can serve as vicious spikes on a deadly trident.
merrow	Merrow	15	Merrow Heart	4 gp	3 lb.	Merrow Amulet		4	3	1		The merrow are twisted merfolk, created from the insane corruption of the Demogorgon. This seed of corruption can be found in their hearts which can be crafted into dark amulets that can grant a portion of the Demon Prince's power, but at great risk to the wearer.
mimic	Mimic	5	Mimic Glue	4 gp	2 lb.		enchanted vial	4	2	1	 (vial)	When a mimic is on the hunt, it produces an extremely powerful adhesive that can hold down even the strongest of adventurers. This adhesive remains usable after the mimic's death so long as it is kept in an airtight environment, and is a common industrial material. Requires enchanted vial.
mimic	Mimic	15	Mimic Gel	4 gp	3 lb.	Mimic Oil	vial	4	3	3	 (3 vials)	The ooze that secretes from an injured mimic carries many unique properties and is the main contributor to the mimic's extraordinary ability to change its appearance. Alchemists have long since discovered how to mix this substance with other ingredients to create a magical oil that can change the appearance of small items.
mind-flayer	Mind Flayer	5	Mind Flayer Mucus	10 gp	1 lb.		vial	10	1	1	 (vial)	The mucus secreted by a well fed mind flayer has a slightly sticky texture and smells roughly of weak formaldahyde. Filled with the thoughts and emotions of the mind flayer's meals, this mucus can undergo an alchemical process to turn into an intoxicating draught known as: Whisper. When consumed, the drinker experiences a rush of euphoria as dozens of minds recount lost knowledge and memories in a cascade of mental whispers. While unpleasant, this drink is considered a high honour in many Underdark societies.
mind-flayer	Mind Flayer	10	Mind Flayer Tentacle	6 gp	4 lb.	Mind Whip		6	4	4	 (x4)	The mouth tentacle of the mind flayer is renowned for affecting more than the physical on every lash. It retains this property beyond the death of its owner, and Underdark interrogators are rumoured to use whips made of these tentacles in their work.
mind-flayer	Mind Flayer	15	Mind Flayer Heart	50 gp	1 lb.	Amulet of the Mind Flayer		50	1	1		A mind flayer heart is a dark organ, filled with vile humours and thin ichors. When transformed into an amulet, it can grant many of the psionic abilities of an illithid, but at a terrible price.
mind-flayer	Mind Flayer	20	Mind Flayer Brain	185 gp	6 lb.	Helm of the Illithid		185	6	1		The incredibly powerful brain of the mind flayer seems to still throb with activity even after removal from its skull. Due to the unique physiology of the illithid race, the consciousness of the mind flayer is still present in the brain, allowing it to be exploited by both adventurers and by the mind flayer's elder brain master alike. Use: Despite being dead, the intact brain of a mind flayer is treated as if it were still a living mind for the purposes of spells and abilities that can interact directly with minds such as the detect thoughts spell. Any time a creature interacts with the mind flayer brain in this way, there is a 10 per cent chance that the elder brain that the mind flayer had a psychic link with becomes aware of this interaction and what occured during this interaction.
minotaur	Minotaur	10	Minotaur Hide	4 gp	25 lb.	Studded Leather, +1 (DMG)		4	25	1		A minotaur resembles cattle in every way that counts. Taking their hides and tanning them into leather is no more distasteful than doing so to an ordinary bull.
minotaur	Minotaur	10	Minotaur Heart	10 gp	4 lb.	Minotaur Compass		10	4	1		The heart of a minotaur is far larger and stronger than a human's or a bull's. Warped by the dark influence of Baphomet, this heart carries strong magic that can be brought out by a talented artificer.
minotaur	Minotaur	15	Minotaur Horn	10 gp	20 lb.	Helm of the Minotaur		10	20	2	 (x2)	The wicked horns of the minotaur have ended more than one hapless adventurer's life. When mounted on a sturdy helm, and with slight magical reinforcement, a wearer can emulate the deadly charge of the horns' original owner.
mummy	Mummy	5	Mummy Bandage (small pouch)	10 gp	4 lb.			10	4	1		The bandages of a mummy are marked with necromantic sigils and soaked in foul oils that curse a corpse with eternal undeath. While the magic can only be used on one corpse, the magical reagents can be recycled by resourceful alchemists. As such, these bandages can fetch a decent price. 
mummy	Mummy	10	Mummy Dust (small pouch)	15 gp	1 lb.	Mummy Rot Juice		15	1	1		The body of a cursed mummy remains cursed even after it has been rendered inanimate. Taking the dry dust from this corpse can serve as the basis for a ghastly potion once mixed with other oils and desert roots. Such a potion and fate should only be reserved for those who have committed the worst of crimes (such as making a mummy in the first place).
mummy-lord	Mummy Lord	5	Mummy Bandage (small pouch)	10 gp	4 lb.			10	4	1		The bandages of a mummy are marked with necromantic sigils and soaked in foul oils that curse a corpse with eternal undeath. While the magic can only be used on one corpse, the magical reagents can be recycled by resourceful alchemists. As such, these bandages can fetch a decent price.

Taking the dry dust from this corpse can serve as the basis for a ghastly potion once mixed with other oils and desert roots. Such a potion and fate should only be reserved for those who have committed the worst of crimes (such as making a mummy in the first place).
mummy-lord	Mummy Lord	20	Mummy Lord Heart	4,500 gp	2 lb.	Amulet of the Desert Tyrant		4500	2	1		The heart of a mummy lord is not actually found in a mummy lord's chest but is sequestered away in a separate container somewhere in the mummy lord's lair. It takes great skill to remove and store the shrivelled organ without damaging it, but if done correctly, can provide a powerful base for artificing. It is, however, advised that one finishes their business with the heart quickly, before its owner comes looking for it.
myconid-sprout	Myconid Sprout	10	Rapport Spores (small pouch)	5 sp	1 lb.	Potion of Rapport		0.5	1	1		This item can only be harvested if the myconid being harvested still had uses of its rapport spores ability. These spores have a unqiue ability to transmit thought between the myconid and other intelligent beings. With some reverse engineering, alchemists have managed to use these spores to create a potion that simulates a similar effect in other creatures.
myconid-adult	Myconid Adult	10	Rapport Spores (small pouch)	5 sp	1 lb.	Potion of Rapport		0.5	1	1		This item can only be harvested if the myconid being harvested still had uses of its rapport spores ability. These spores have a unqiue ability to transmit thought between the myconid and other intelligent beings. With some reverse engineering, alchemists have managed to use these spores to create a potion that simulates a similar effect in other creatures.
myconid-adult	Myconid Adult	15	Pacifying Spores (small pouch)	9 sp	1 lb.			0.9	1	1		This item can only be harvested if the myconid being harvested still had use of its pacifying spores ability. The pacifying spores of an adult myconid are capable of stopping even the largest of creatures, if at least temporarily. Stored properly, they can be packed into small clusters and used in much the same manner as their original owner used them. Use: As an action you may make a ranged weapon attack and throw the pouch of pacifying spores at a target within 10 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be stunned for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
myconid-sovereign	Myconid Sovereign	10	Rapport Spores (small pouch)	5 sp	1 lb.	Potion of Rapport		0.5	1	1		This item can only be harvested if the myconid being harvested still had uses of its rapport spores ability. These spores have a unqiue ability to transmit thought between the myconid and other intelligent beings. With some reverse engineering, alchemists have managed to use these spores to create a potion that simulates a similar effect in other creatures.
myconid-sovereign	Myconid Sovereign	15	Pacifying Spores (small pouch)	9 sp	1 lb.			0.9	1	1		This item can only be harvested if the myconid being harvested still had use of its pacifying spores ability. The pacifying spores of an adult myconid are capable of stopping even the largest of creatures, if at least temporarily. Stored properly, they can be packed into small clusters and used in much the same manner as their original owner used them.

The target must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be stunned for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
myconid-sovereign	Myconid Sovereign	20	Hallucination Spores (small pouch)	2 gp	1 lb.			2	1	1		The hallucination spores created by the myconid sovereign create a strong psychedelic effect in any creature that inhales them. Imbibers have described visions of strong lights and strange images, and an overall satisfied feeling afterwards. Underdark societies are known to hunt sovereigns down just for these spores, which is a shame because most would happily share the spores to any visitor who just asked politely. Use: You may make a ranged weapon attack at a creature within 10 feet by throwing the pouch at them. Upon a successful hit, the target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. The poisoned target is incapacitated while it hallucinates. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
myconid-sovereign	Myconid Sovereign	25	Animating Spores (small pouch)	3 gp	1 lb.			3	1	1		This item can only be harvested if the myconid being harvested still had use of its animating spores ability. The animating spores of a myconid sovereign holds a strange place between schools of magic. Holding characterstics of necromantic, enchantment, and transfiguration, these spores continue to vex even the foremost scholars of the day. Use: As an action, you may sprinkle these spores over the corpse of a humanoid or a Large or smaller beast within 5 feet. In 24 hours, the corpse rises as a spore servant (refer to the Monster Manual for the statblock). The corpse stays animated fo 1d4+1 weeks or until destroyed, and it can't be animated again in this way.
bone-naga	Bone Naga	10	Naga Bone	20 gp	15 lb.			20	15	1		Virtually identical to the bones of an ordinary serpant, except on a larger scale. When ground up into a powder and then brewed into a tea however, it creates an intoxicating drink that some cultures have used for spiritual purposes. Those that have drunk it have claimed visions of long-forgotten histories, but they are inevitably forgotten once the drink has left their system.
bone-naga	Bone Naga	15	Skeletal Naga Fang	30 gp	12 lb.	Viper Strike		30	12	2	 (x2)	Nagas require no glands to produce their venom as their fangs remain venomous even when the naga is reduced to a skeletal form. Proper extraction and then resmithing allows these fangs to serve as powerful weapons with an extra poisonous punch. Beware though, as a revived naga may not take kindly to the idea of a mortal running around with one of their teeth.
spirit-naga	Spirit Naga	10	Naga Bone	20 gp	15 lb.			20	15	1		Virtually identical to the bones of an ordinary serpant, except on a larger scale. When ground up into a powder and then brewed into a tea however, it creates an intoxicating drink that some cultures have used for spiritual purposes. Those that have drunk it have claimed visions of long-forgotten histories, but they are inevitably forgotten once the drink has left their system.
spirit-naga	Spirit Naga	10	Naga Scale (3 small pouches)	30 gp	6 lb.	Potion of Superior Healing (DMG)		30	6	1		Nagas are renowned for their rejuvenation abilities, and this property transfers to their scales. Indeed, powdered naga scales are one of many potential catalysts required when brewing the ubiquitous healing potion. 
spirit-naga	Spirit Naga	15	Spirit Naga Fang	125 gp	12 lb.	Viper Strike		125	12	2	 (x2)	Nagas require no glands to produce their venom as their fangs remain venomous even when the naga is reduced to a skeletal form. Proper extraction and then resmithing allows these fangs to serve as powerful weapons with an extra poisonous punch. Beware though, as a revived naga may not take kindly to the idea of a mortal running around with one of their teeth.
guardian-naga	Guardian Naga	10	Naga Bone	20 gp	15 lb.			20	15	1		Virtually identical to the bones of an ordinary serpant, except on a larger scale. When ground up into a powder and then brewed into a tea however, it creates an intoxicating drink that some cultures have used for spiritual purposes. Those that have drunk it have claimed visions of long-forgotten histories, but they are inevitably forgotten once the drink has left their system.
guardian-naga	Guardian Naga	10	Naga Scale (3 small pouches)	70 gp	6 lb.	Potion of Superior Healing (DMG)		70	6	1		Nagas are renowned for their rejuvenation abilities, and this property transfers to their scales. Indeed, powdered naga scales are one of many potential catalysts required when brewing the ubiquitous healing potion. 
guardian-naga	Guardian Naga	15	Guardian Naga Fang	300 gp	12 lb.	Viper Strike		300	12	2	 (x2)	Nagas require no glands to produce their venom as their fangs remain venomous even when the naga is reduced to a skeletal form. Proper extraction and then resmithing allows these fangs to serve as powerful weapons with an extra poisonous punch. Beware though, as a revived naga may not take kindly to the idea of a mortal running around with one of their teeth.
guardian-naga	Guardian Naga	20 (0 if willingly given by the guardian naga)	Naga Heart	-	15 lb.			-	15	1		The heart of a guardian naga may be taken by force, but it is only useful when given freely by the benevolent creatures. When eaten, the recipient gains the naga's rejuvenation ability for at least one death. In exchange, the naga's own cycle of rebirth is temporarily halted. A guardian naga only does this when it sees great potential in a mortal creature and wishes to be a part of that creature fulfilling their destiny. Use: If the naga heart is taken and eaten under the free and willing permission of the guardian naga, the eater temporarily gains the ability to return to life after death. If the eater dies, they will return to life in 1d6 days and regain all hit points, missing body parts, and be cured of all non-magical diseases. Only a wish spell can prevent this trait from functioning. In addition, the naga from whom the heart was taken loses its rejuvenation ability until the creature that ate their heart returns to life for the first time using this ability. After the eater returns to life for the first time using this ability, they lose this ability.
nightmare	Nightmare	10	Nightmare Ashes (small pouch)	15 gp	1 lb.	Potion of Fire Resistance (DMG)		15	1	1		Nightmares have the ability to grant fire resistance to any creature riding them, ostensibly to avoid burning their riders to death. Upon their death, taking some of their ashes and leaving them in a crucible overnight can create one of the key ingredients of a potion of fire resistance.
nightmare	Nightmare	15	Nightmare Hoof	8 gp	12 lb.	Figurine of Wondrous Power (Obsidian Statue) (DMG) 		8	12	4	 (x4)	The hooves of a nightmare are jet black and with a bit of artificing, along with expert crafting, they can be turned into miniature statues of the very nightmare they were taken from. This statue contains much of the original nightmare's abilities, trapped inside a figurine form.
nothic	Nothic	10	Nothic Brain	30 gp	4 lb.			30	4	1		The nothic brain is immense; existing as both a testament and mockery to the nothic's former intellectual callings. Despite its veil of madness, wells of knowledge still exist within it, for those that know how to bring it out. Use: You may spend 1 day pulping, drying, and mixing this item with various reagents. The resulting mixture creates a magical ink that contains magical knowledge. A character with at least 3 levels in the wizard class may use this ink to write in their spellbook. If they do so, they subconsciously write down a random spell (chosen by the DM) of 2nd level or lower into their spellbook. Regardless of the level of the spell, this transcription takes 2 hours and costs nothing except the usage of all the ink. This copied spell functions as well as any other spell copied into the book through a mundane method.
nothic	Nothic	15	Nothic Eye	20 gp	3 lb.	Lens of Insight		20	3	1		The bulging, lidless eye of a nothic is its main source of power. Capable of seeing more than mortals were meant to, it provides a good framework for constructing magical devices capable of performing similar feats as its original owner.
ogre	Ogre	5	Ogre Fat	1 gp	1 lb.	Repelling Candle	vial	1	1	3	 (3 vials)	An ogre has a repugnant odor that seems to combine mouldy cheese, sour feet, and dank mud all at once. The fat around their rotund bellies seem to be the most potent source of this smell, and it takes a very stalwart alchemist to render this fat into tallow to make a vaguely magical candle.
ogre	Ogre	10	Ogre Hide	2 gp	30 lb.			2	30	1		The tough skin of an ogre is undoubtedly smelly and unpleasent. However, when tanned, it makes for a very durable leather, and many tanners would be glad to have them.
ogre	Ogre	15	Ogre Hand	5 gp	35 lb.	Gaunlets of Ogre Power (DMG)		5	35	2	 (x2)	Brutish, rough, and very large, the hands of an ogre are meant for little more than wielding a club to smash those smaller than their owner.
half-ogre	Half-Ogre	10	Half-Ogre Blood	5 sp	1 lb.	Potion of Ogre Strength	vial	0.5	1	5	 (5 vials)	The blood of a regular ogre is too foreign and extreme to be compatible with that of a humanoid's system. A half-ogre on the other hand has the perfect dilution of humanoid blood for it to not be toxic to a humanoid, while still conferring the power of its giant pregenitor.
oni	Oni	5	Oni Horn	5 gp	5 lb.			5	5	1		The horns of an oni are incredibly hard and serve only to add to the oni's devilish appearance. They carry only trace amounts of the oni's innate magic, but they make good magical implements. Cannibalistic cults have often taken to using these horns as ceremonial flasks in their depraved rituals.
oni	Oni	10	Oni Blood	2 gp	1 lb.	Potion of Superior Healing (DMG)	vial	2	1	5	 (5 vials)	Despite being ogres, oni blood carries regenerative properties usually only seen in trolls. This powerful blood is one of the many potential catalysts used for brewing the ubiquitous healing potion.
oni	Oni	15	Oni Eye	35 gp	2 lb.	Goggles of Night (DMG)		35	2	2	 (x2)	The eyes of an oni appear to glow long after they have been pried from their foul sockets. If you are willing to use them, they can be crafted into goggles useful for the adventurer with no darkvision.
oni	Oni	20	Oni Hand	55 gp	35 lb.	Gauntlets of Ogre Power (DMG)		55	35	2	 (x2)	The hands of an oni are much like any other ogre's; tough and powerful. When taken to a blacksmith with a magical bent, they can be crafted into gauntlets of ogre power just like any other ogre's.
oni	Oni	25	Oni Heart	500 gp	5 lb.	Oni Amulet		500	5	1		The heart of an oni is black as a moonless night and just as terrifying. Used as a conduit, an amulet crafted from this organ can grant the wearer some of the oni's magical properties.
black-pudding	Black Pudding	10	Black Residue	20 gp	1 lb.		enchanted vial	20	1	1	 (vial)	A sample of a black pudding. Inert due to lacking enough biomass to constitute a full ooze, it nevertheless retains its acidic properties. Can be used as a potent acid. Requires enchanted vial.Use: A vial of black residue can be poured onto nonmagical wood or metal. The black residue eats through 2 inches of these materials per round for the next 10 rounds, after which the ooze becomes too diluted to continue.
gelatinous-cube	Gelatinous Cube	10	Gelatinous Residue	7 gp	1 lb.		enchanted vial	7	1	1	 (vial)	The gelatinous residue from a gelatinous cube carries much of the same acidic properties from its original form. Unlike samples taken from other oozes, the gelatinous cube's acid is difficult to identify when mixed with other liquids, making it the substance of choice among assassins with a subtler touch. Requires enchanted vial. Use: Drinking the gelatinous residue automatically deals 6d6 acid damage to the drinker. The gelatinous residue may be mixed with up to 5 oz. of other liquid and still retain this property. A DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check can identify a liquid that has had gelatinous residue mixed into it.
gray-ooze	Gray Ooze	10	Gray Residue	7 gp	1 lb.		enchanted vial	7	1	1	 (vial)	Not as potent as a black pudding, but highly acidic nonetheless. Some blacksmithing techniques actually use this acid in advanced smithing projects, but the difficulty and volatility of controlling the residue has made this a rather esoteric artform. Requires enchanted vial. Use: A vial of gray residue can be poured on a piece of nonmagical metal. This ooze will eat through 2 inches of that metal every round for the next 10 rounds, after which it becomes too diluted to continue.
ochre-jelly	Ochre Jelly	10	Ochre Residue	7 gp	1 lb.		vial	7	1	1	 (vial)	The wobbly material of an ochre jelly is not as potent as other oozes. Indeed, it is weak enough that it can be treated with large amounts of other ingredients and consumed safely. It is not actually uncommon to stumble upon a tribe of kobolds that have set themselves up in a dungeon and farm the local ochre jellies in order to brew a rather noxious ale.
orc	Orc	5	Orc Blood	1 gp	1 lb.		vial	1	1	3	 (3 vials)	The gift of fertility that was granted to the orcs by their deity, Luthic, also gave their other fluids full compatability with other humanoids. As such, drinking the blood of an orc can temporarily grant other humanoids some of the legendary ferocity of the orcs. Use: When you drink this vial of blood, you feel more aggressive for the next 10 minutes. During this time, you may spend your bonus action to move up to your speed toward a hostile creature you can see. After the 10 minutes have passed, you must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or suffer one point of exhaustion.
orc-war-chief	Orc War Chief	5	Orc Blood	1 gp	1 lb.		vial	1	1	3	 (3 vials)	The gift of fertility that was granted to the orcs by their deity, Luthic, also gave their other fluids full compatability with other humanoids. As such, drinking the blood of an orc can temporarily grant other humanoids some of the legendary ferocity of the orcs. Use: When you drink this vial of blood, you feel more aggressive for the next 10 minutes. During this time, you may spend your bonus action to move up to your speed toward a hostile creature you can see. After the 10 minutes have passed, you must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or suffer one point of exhaustion.
orc-war-chief	Orc War Chief	10	Gruumsh-touched Orc Heart	5 gp	6 lb.			5	6	1		The heart of an orc touched by Gruumsh is considerably larger than a regular one. Many would find the consumption of this heart to be barbaric, but it would be no more barbaric than what the original owner of this heart has done. Use: As an action you may consume this heart. For the next 10 minutes, you deal an extra 1d8 damage when you hit with a weapon attack. This benefit can not be taken by any character with Elvish ancestry.
orc-war-chief	Orc War Chief	15	Orc Warchief Tusk	10 gp	4 lb.			10	4	2	 (x2)	Orcish war chiefs famously decorate their large tusks with all manner of jewelery and precious stones, presumably so you can be dazzled by their riches before they bite your head off. Many merchants will pay a good price for these tusks, if only for the sheer novelty of it.
orc-eye-of-gruumsh	Orc Eye of Gruumsh	5	Orc Blood	1 gp	1 lb.		vial	1	1	3	 (3 vials)	The gift of fertility that was granted to the orcs by their deity, Luthic, also gave their other fluids full compatability with other humanoids. As such, drinking the blood of an orc can temporarily grant other humanoids some of the legendary ferocity of the orcs. Use: When you drink this vial of blood, you feel more aggressive for the next 10 minutes. During this time, you may spend your bonus action to move up to your speed toward a hostile creature you can see. After the 10 minutes have passed, you must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or suffer one point of exhaustion.
orc-eye-of-gruumsh	Orc Eye of Gruumsh	10	Gruumsh-touched Orc Heart	5 gp	6 lb.			5	6	1		The heart of an orc touched by Gruumsh is considerably larger than a regular one. Many would find the consumption of this heart to be barbaric, but it would be no more barbaric than what the original owner of this heart has done. Use: As an action you may consume this heart. For the next 10 minutes, you deal an extra 1d8 damage when you hit with a weapon attack. This benefit can not be taken by any character with Elvish ancestry.
orc-eye-of-gruumsh	Orc Eye of Gruumsh	15	Orc Eye of Gruumsh	15 gp	1 lb.			15	1	1		The remaining eye of an orc who has already sacrificed one to their god still carries magical potential. Arcanists and religious scholars would pay a fair price for one of these eyes, to further study the machinations of the evil orcish god. The fact that this eye seems to always glare at anyone with elvish ancestry should probably just be ignored.
orog	Orog	5	Orc Blood	1 gp	1 lb.		vial	1	1	3	 (3 vials)	The gift of fertility that was granted to the orcs by their deity, Luthic, also gave their other fluids full compatability with other humanoids. As such, drinking the blood of an orc can temporarily grant other humanoids some of the legendary ferocity of the orcs. Use: When you drink this vial of blood, you feel more aggressive for the next 10 minutes. During this time, you may spend your bonus action to move up to your speed toward a hostile creature you can see. After the 10 minutes have passed, you must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or suffer one point of exhaustion.
orog	Orog	10	Gruumsh-touched Orc Heart	5 gp	6 lb.			5	6	1		The heart of an orc touched by Gruumsh is considerably larger than a regular one. Many would find the consumption of this heart to be barbaric, but it would be no more barbaric than what the original owner of this heart has done. Use: As an action you may consume this heart. For the next 10 minutes, you deal an extra 1d8 damage when you hit with a weapon attack. This benefit can not be taken by any character with Elvish ancestry.
otyugh	Otyugh	5	Otyugh Bile	5 gp	1 lb.		vial	5	1	1	 (vial)	As disgusting as the idea may sound, otyugh bile, capable of digesting just about anything, actually makes for a very good medicine for indigestion. A common remedy prescibred by a village's medicine woman is a dose of diluted otyugh bile mixed with a spoonful of honey (mostly to mask the taste).
otyugh	Otyugh	10	Otyugh Saliva	40 gp	1 lb.		vial	40	1	1	 (vial)	An otyugh's saliva is not actually poisonous, but it is loaded with so much bacteria and disease that it may as well be. Use: This saliva can be used to coat up to 5 pieces of slashing or piercing ammunition or one slashing or piercing weapon. Applying the poison takes 1 minute. For the next minute, any creature successfully hit must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw against disease or become poisoned until the disease is cured. For every 24 hours that elapse, the target must repeat the saving throw, reducing its hit point maximum by 1d10 on a failure. The disease is cured on a success. The target dies if the disease reduces its hit point maximum to 0. This reduction to the target's hit point maximum lasts until the disease is cured.
otyugh	Otyugh	15	Otyugh Tentacle	25 gp	15 lb.	Otyugh Whip		25	15	1		The tentacles of an otyugh are tipped with incredibly sharp needles that both pierce its foes and allow it to drag them around. Underdark slavers are often found with whips made from these tentacles, designed to capture their prey alive.
otyugh	Otyugh	20	Otyugh Telepathy Ganglia	100 gp	2 lb.	Sensory Collar		100	2	1		An odd cluster of nerves at the section in which the otyugh's tentacles meet its back. The composition is incompatible with the more complicated brain structure of a humanoid, but it actually does work on simpler life forms like beasts.
owlbear	Owlbear	10	Owlbear Feathers (large bag)	2 gp	5 lb.			2	5	1		The feathers of an owlbear are noticebly soft and downy, in contrast to their more ferocious appearance. While these feathers make for poor fletching, they actually do make fantastic bedding material, and owlbear feather stuffed pillows are the hallmark of any well equipped bedroom.
owlbear	Owlbear	15	Owlbear Liver	10 gp	6 lb.			10	6	1		The liver of an owlbear is a potent medicinal ingredient, used to treat everything from indigestion, to kidney stones, to mudgut. Unfortunately, this very property has led to owlbears facing overhunting in some regions.
owlbear	Owlbear	20	Owlbear Neck	50 gp	10 lb.	Warning Scarf		50	10	1		Ask anybody who has once tried to hide from an owlbear, and they will tell you of how futile that effort is. Their keen eyesight, hearing, and sense of smell, combined with their eerie owl-like tendency to twist their heads behind them while tracking, make them a terrifying predator to elude. A scarf made from a part of their carcass also grants some level of these senses, giving its owner some level of heightened awareness.
pegasus	Pegasus	5	Pegasus Hair (small pouch)	2 gp	3 lb.			2	3	1		Pure white, majestic, and incredibly durable, the hair of a pegasus is coveted as a crafting material. Everything from rope, to instruments, to bows have been strung with pegasus hair, and always sold at a premium.
pegasus	Pegasus	10	Pegasus Hoof	1 gp	14 lb.	Traveller's Clogs		1	14	4	 (x4)	The hooves of a pegasus can be ground down and rendered into a glue like a regular horse's. This glue however has a certain glittery imperfection in it that is actually enjoyed by noble ladies fond of extravagance. This glue has been converted into various cosmetics or as a final flourish to an already decadent gown.
pegasus	Pegasus	15	Pegasus Blood	4 gp	1 lb.	Potion of Stamina	vial	4	1	3	 (3 vials)	Pegasus blood is a brilliant sheen of silver with a rainbow reflection on its surface. Well known as a medicine, it is often sold to middle-aged men as a fertility potion.
pegasus	Pegasus	20	Pegasus Wing	10 gp	35 lb.	Potion of Flying (DMG)		10	35	2	 (x2)	The glorious wings of a pegasus, resembling two nimbuses on a corporeal body. It takes a very steady hand to remove these fragile appendages without ruining them, but if done correctly, they can be used as ingredients in the ever useful potion of flying.
peryton	Peryton	10	Peryton Horn	3 gp	12 lb.			3	12	2	 (x2)	The large horns of a peryton are considered quite striking for their strange black lustre. Whether used as a decoration or ground up for medicine, they tend to fetch a decent price. There is also a rumour that a set of dice crafted from the horns of a peryton are particularly easy to use in cheating. This is unsubstantiated, however.
peryton	Peryton	15	Peryton Heart	20 gp	5 lb.	Curse of Jealousy		20	5	1		Perytons have a strange fixation with hearts. While theories abound of their origin in regards to the eating of hearts, it can be confirmed that a peryton's own heart does carry dark magical energy.
peryton	Peryton	20	Peryton Wing	10 gp	35 lb.	Potion of Flying (DMG)		10	35	2	 (x2)	The black wings of a peryton are incredibly powerful and agile. When removed properly, they can be used as ingredients in the ever useful potion of flying.
piercer	Piercer	5	Piercer Musk	1 gp	1 lb.		vial	1	1	1	 (vial)	The horrible smelling musk of a piercer, while unpleasent, is not debilitatingly so. Ironically enough, this musk can undergo an alchemical process to be transformed into a rather expensive perfume. Of course, those marketing it are usually reluctant to tell their buyers what it is made out of.
piercer	Piercer	10	Piercer Shell	2 gp	20 lb.			2	20	1		The slug-like piercer is covered in a rock-like shell that gives it the appearance of a stalactite or stalagmite. This hard shell has been repurposed into many things in Underdark societies including bowls, furniture, and various tools.
pixie	Pixie	15	Pixie Dust (small pouch)	3 gp	1 lb.			3	1	1		The ubiquitous dust dropped by the wings of pixies. Incredibly magical, yet volatile, it is virtually impossible for a non-pixie to determine what will happen when sprinkled on a creature. Use: As an action, you may sprinkle some pixie dust on a creature next to you. If sprinkled on an unwilling creature, they may resist any resulting effect by succeeding on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw. If sprinkled on a willing creature, or an unwilling creature that failed their saving throw, roll 1d10 and consult the pixie dust effect table for the result. If the result would involve a saving throw, the DC is 12. A small pouch of pixie dust has enough dust in it for 3 uses.
pseudodragon	Pseudodragon	10	Pseudodragon Venom	5 gp	1 lb.		vial	5	1	1	 (vial)	The venom of a pseudodragon has a soporific effect that some alchemists have actually used to create a draught to treat insomnia. Of course, in its pure state, it can still be used as an effective tranquiliser. Use: Can be used to coat 1 piece of slashing or piercing ammunition or one slashing or piercing weapon. Applying the poison takes an action. The next time that the coated ammunition or weapon successfully hits a creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 hour. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target falls unconscious for the same duration, or until it takes damage or another creature uses an action to shake it awake.
purple-worm	Purple Worm	5	Purple Worm Blood	130 gp	1 lb.		vial	130	1	9	 (9 vials)	It is a simple fact of Underdark life that you need to have a purple worm ward if you wish to have a long-term settlement. Ironically, these wards require the blood of a purple worm in order to be created. In a way, though it is fitting that only a society that can kill a purple worm can be protected from them. Natural selection at its finest, as it were.
purple-worm	Purple Worm	10	Purple Worm Bile	150 gp	1 lb.		vial	150	1	3	 (3 vials)	The incredibly corrosive bile of a purple worm is coveted by miners for being able to literally eat through rocks that would otherwise take weeks of work to break through. Just be careful when harvesting it, however, you don't want to be known as the fool who was eaten by an already slain purple worm. Use: As an action you may make a ranged weapon attack to throw a vial of purple worm bile at a target within 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against the target, treating the vial as an improvised object. On a hit, the target suffers 5d6 acid damage.
purple-worm	Purple Worm	15	Purple Worm Tooth	150 gp	30 lb.	Any melee piercing weapon, +2 (DMG)		150	30	4	 (x4)	Purple worm teeth resemble stalactities and stalagmites in their cavernous mouth more than anything else. Larger than a grown human's arm, these teeth make very good crafting materials and are a rich source of ivory. Alternatively, they can be crafted into fine weapons.
purple-worm	Purple Worm	20	Purple Worm Stinger	2,200 gp	40 lb.	Purple Piercer		2200	40	1		Despite what you may think, it is not much safer to be on the opposite side of a purple worm's mouth, as its tail is perhaps even more deadly. When the stinger head is taken and recrafted into a weapon, it can deliver payloads of venom just as it did when attached to its original owner. 
purple-worm	Purple Worm	25	Purple Worm Pearl	5,000 gp	10 lb.			5000	10	1		With all the dirt and rock that a purple worm chews through, it inevitably swallows some precious gems and metals. These are not digested easily and often clump together in the purple worm's stomach. Melded together by digestive acids and pressure, they form beautiful unique pearls that fetch incredibly high prices on open markets.
quaggoth	Quaggoth	5	Quaggoth Fur (small pouch)	1 gp	4 lb.			1	4	1		Shaggy and coarse, it would not be immediately apparent that quaggoth fur has much use as anything except as a trophy. The fur however has remarkable insulation qualities, and while uncomfortable, can stuff a coat to keep an adventurer warm in even the deepest and darkest Underdark tunnel. 
quaggoth	Quaggoth	10	Quaggoth Blood	1 gp	1 lb.	Potion of Poison Resistance (DMG)	vial	1	1	3	 (3 vials)	Due to their horrible Underdark diets, quaggoths have developed several enzymes and antibodies that make them immune to poisons. If used in an alchemy recipe, it creates a potion of poison resistance. 
quaggoth	Quaggoth	15	Quaggoth Brain (Quaggoth Thonot only)	6 gp	5 lb.			6	5	1		The psionic energy of the Underdark occasionally causes mutations in the susceptible quaggoth population, creating what is known as a thonot. Their brains are noticably larger and capable of psionic feats themselves. When eaten, these psionic abilities are temporarily bequeathed to the eater. Use: You may spend an action to eat this brain. For the next hour, you may cast the feather fall and mage hand spells at will without using a spell slot or requiring any spell components. 
rakshasa	Rakshasa	10	Rakshasa Claw	50 gp	3 lb.	Curse of Nightmares		50	3	2	 (x2)	The hatred and malice inherent in a rakshasa is embodied in their deformed claws, capable of imparting a curse that spites any it strikes. When burned in an occult ritual, the ashes can create a dye used in dark rituals to curse unwary hoarders of magical items.
rakshasa	Rakshasa	15	Rakshasa Heart	450 gp	4 lb.	Amulet of the Trickster		450	4	1		The rakshasa's tendency to kill and subsume the lives of its victims is almost legendary. The heart of the rakshasa drips with this malicious coveting of others' identities, and can be refashioned into an amulet that allows its wielder to do the same.
rakshasa	Rakshasa	20	Rakshasa Hide	1,300 gp	15 lb.	Cloak of Magic Immunity		1300	15	1		While not as potent once removed from its original body, the removed hide of a rakshasa still carries the magical resistance that it is famous for. When reinforced properly, it becomes a fearsome cloak that shrugs off weak spells.
young-remorhaz	Young Remorhaz	10	Remorhaz Blood	2 gp	1 lb.	Potion of Elemental Tempering	vial	2	1	5	 (5 vials)	Anybody who has slain a remorhaz can attest to the virtually boiling blood that spews forth from its open wounds. This blood remains supernaturally warm long after being removed from its body, and arctic cultures use bladders of this as a form of insulation and heating.
young-remorhaz	Young Remorhaz	15	Remorhaz Antenna	25 gp	6 lb.	Security Antenna		25	6	2	 (x2)	The remorhaz has the uncanny ability to sense the movements of creatures around it, based mostly around its incredibly senstive antennae. If taken in whole, they may be re-adapted to be used as a pair of dowsing rods for security purposes.
young-remorhaz	Young Remorhaz	20	Young Remorhaz Carapace	115 gp	65 lb.	Remorhaz Plate		115	65	1		The thick, iron-like scales of even a young remorhaz have incredible insulation properties and can regulate the creature's insect-like body.
remorhaz	Remorhaz	10	Adult Remorhaz Blood	10 gp	1 lb.	Potion of Elemental Tempering	vial	10	1	7	 (7 vials)	Anybody who has slain a remorhaz can attest to the virtually boiling blood that spews forth from its open wounds. This blood remains supernaturally warm long after being removed from its body, and arctic cultures use bladders of this as a form of insulation and heating.
remorhaz	Remorhaz	15	Remorhaz Antenna	25 gp	6 lb.	Security Antenna		25	6	2	 (x2)	The remorhaz has the uncanny ability to sense the movements of creatures around it, based mostly around its incredibly senstive antennae. If taken in whole, they may be re-adapted to be used as a pair of dowsing rods for security purposes.
remorhaz	Remorhaz	20	Adult Remorhaz Carapace	1,000 gp	65 lb.	Remorhaz Plate, +1		1000	65	1		A full grown remorhaz's carapace is twice as thick and durable than in its youth. This carapace when taken and resmelted, becomes an almost impenetrable barrier against both weapons and the elements.
revenant	Revenant	20	Imprint of Vengeance	Varies	1 lb.		spirit paper	Varies	1	1		A revenant's body contains nothing of value that an ordinary corpse would not already possess, and it is usually beyond the abilities of an average harvester to seal away the vengeance fuelled soul of a revenant. However, with quick action and some spirit paper, an imprint of the soul may be saved, allowing one to track the creature that wronged the revenant so badly. Requires spirit paper. Use: While holding this item, you constantly know the distance to and direction of any creature against which the revenant seeks revenge, even if the creature is on a different plane of existence. You become aware if the creature being tracked dies. While holding this paper, the revenant is similarly also aware of your distance and direction to them.
roc	Roc	10	Roc Gizzards	30 gp	30 lb.			30	30	1		Roc is considered quite the delicacy in many mountainous regions. The gizzards of a roc in particular are highly nutritious and fry up wonderfully with onions and root vegetables.
roc	Roc	15	Roc Beak	150 gp	30 lb.	Warhammer, +2 (DMG)		150	30	1		Larger than most humans (as many hapless adventurers find out far too late), this beak is also incredibly strong and capable of smashing steel armour to bits. It is common to find giants using these beaks as various tools, but for a Medium sized creature, it makes for the head of a fine hammer.
roc	Roc	20	Roc's Feather	800 gp	1 lb.			800	1	1		The feather of a roc contains magical properties that make it capable of lifting a creature as large as the roc. It is however difficult to find a sample that retains this property after being removed from the roc's body. Use: While holding this item, you may cast the jump spell on yourself at will. This spell ends if you stop holding the feather.
roc	Roc	25	Roc Heart Piece	2,300 gp	15 lb.	Ring of Storm Giant Growth		2300	15	1		The massive heart of a roc is usually too much for an average adventurer to carry home by themselves. Luckily, the only thing of value is a smaller chamber of the organ about the size of a large basket. This is said to be the place touched by the giant god Annam and is what gives the roc its gargantuan size.
roper	Roper	5	Roper Saliva	5 gp	1 lb.		vial	5	1	1	 (vial)	A piercer continues to produce its horrible musk even as it grows into a full roper, except it now produces it from its stinking maw. It can still be turned into a perfume, even if the thought of doing so is unpleasant.
roper	Roper	10	Roper Shell	10 gp	60 lb.			10	60	1		The even harder and rougher exterior of a fully grown roper has many usages in Underdark culture. It is not uncommon to find many different pieces in an Underdark dwellers home crafted from these shells.
roper	Roper	15	Roper Tendril	10 gp	25 lb.	Debilitating Whip		10	25	6	 (x6)	The trademark tendrils of the roper are still just as useful after removal from their body as before. Due to the roper's endless ability to reproduce these appendages, some Underdark societies actually raise live ropers specifically to take their tentacles as rope and crafting material. The resulting aesthetic of their ropework is disturbing to say the least. If you want to use them for the creation of a whip however, it requires a steady hand in order to not damage the fragile hairs that give it its debiliating qualities. 
rust-monster	Rust Monster	5	Rust Monster Bile	1 gp	1 lb.		vial	1	1	1	 (vial)	Even though a rust monster may be considered a blacksmith's biggest nightmare, their bile is considered a valuable commodity in their line of work. Strong enough to break down rust and metal, careful usage of their bile can be used to restore old weapons to new, and sometimes can be used to craft metal patterns that would be impossible otherwise.
rust-monster	Rust Monster	10	Rust Monster Antenna	1 gp	12 lb.	Metal Detector		1	12	2	 (x2)	Rust monsters have the simultaneously wondrous and aggravating ability to sense any ferrous metal within 30 feet of it. This is a property of their antennae, which can be repurposed into metal detectors for ordinary humanoids (their corrosive abilities being neutralised in the process of course).
rust-monster	Rust Monster	15	Rust Monster Dust (large bag)	3 gp	10 lb.			3	10	1		Taking the carapace of a rust monster and grinding it down into a dust is an all too common tactic for subterranean cultures. This dust continues to carry the corrosive property of the rust monster, and can be used as either a defense neutralising weapon, or as a cruel practical joke. Use: As an action you may toss a handful of rust monster dust at a ferrous non-magical metal item within 5 feet. Upon contact, the dust corrodes and destroys a 1-foot cube of the material. If the item is being worn or carried by a creature, that creature may attempt a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw to avoid this effect. If the object touched is a weapon or armour/shield, it suffers a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to damage rolls or AC offered respectively. If this penalty reaches -5 for a weapon, drops a piece of armour's offered AC to 10, or drops a shield's AC bonus to 0, then that item is destroyed. A single bag of rust monster dust has enough dust to be used 5 times. 
sahuagin	Sahuagin	5	Sahuagin Blood	5 sp	1 lb.	Potion of the Sahuagin	vial	0.5	1	3	 (3 vials)	Sahuagin are notoriously prone to mutations, manifesting in effects as varied as developing elven characteristics or an extra set of arms. This mutagenic effect works both ways, and their blood is capable of transferring some of a sahuagin's traits to a regular humanoid. It is strongly advised against regular intake of this however, as the full side effects are still unknown.
sahuagin-priestess	Sahuagin Priestess	5	Sahuagin Blood	5 sp	1 lb.	Potion of the Sahuagin	vial	0.5	1	3	 (3 vials)	Sahuagin are notoriously prone to mutations, manifesting in effects as varied as developing elven characteristics or an extra set of arms. This mutagenic effect works both ways, and their blood is capable of transferring some of a sahuagin's traits to a regular humanoid. It is strongly advised against regular intake of this however, as the full side effects are still unknown.
sahuagin-priestess	Sahuagin Priestess	10	Blessing of Sekolah	3 gp	1 lb.			3	1	1		Occasionally, the shark god Sekolah chooses a female sahuagin to be one of their priestesses and imbues them with great divine power. Their spellwork aside, these priestesses can be identified by a marking on the priestesses skin that resembles the bite pattern of a full grown shark. This skin can be used as a short-term charm to copy the shark taming ability of a sahuagin. Use: As an action you may raise this blessing in front of you. Any shark within 120 feet of you that can see you instantly becomes friendly towards you and obeys any command you issue to it, so long as that command does not conflict with that of a real sahuagin. 24 hours after being removed from its original body, this blessing deteriorates and becomes useless.
sahuagin-baron	Sahuagin Baron	5	Sahuagin Blood	5 sp	1 lb.	Potion of the Sahuagin	vial	0.5	1	3	 (3 vials)	Sahuagin are notoriously prone to mutations, manifesting in effects as varied as developing elven characteristics or an extra set of arms. This mutagenic effect works both ways, and their blood is capable of transferring some of a sahuagin's traits to a regular humanoid. It is strongly advised against regular intake of this however, as the full side effects are still unknown.
fire-snake	Fire Snake	5	Salamander Blood	1 gp	1 lb.	Salamander Fire	enchanted vial	1	1	3	 (3 vials)	The blood of a salamander continues to boil with a furious energy long after the salamander's death. Smiths around the world value samples of this blood as a potent fuel source for their forges that allow them to smelt metals that they could not otherwise. Requires enchanted vial.
fire-snake	Fire Snake	10	Fire Snake Scales (small pouch)	3 gp	12 lb.	Warming Waterskin		3	12	1		Salamander scales stay supernaturally warm even after removal from their body. It is not uncommon for wealthy merchants to have winter beds lined with these scales to keep them comfortable in the colder months. Unfortunately, the scales of a young salamander are too soft and small to be used for a set of armour.
salamander	Salamander	5	Salamander Blood	1 gp	1 lb.	Salamander Fire	enchanted vial	1	1	5	 (5 vials)	The blood of a salamander continues to boil with a furious energy long after the salamander's death. Smiths around the world value samples of this blood as a potent fuel source for their forges that allow them to smelt metals that they could not otherwise. Requires enchanted vial.
salamander	Salamander	10	Salamander Fang	20 gp	2 lb.	Fire Dagger		20	2	1		Even though they now have arms to wield weapons, a salamander could very easily still use its formidable bite to kill its foes. Their fangs in particular radiate a deadly heat that can be transferred to a knife when recrafted.
salamander	Salamander	15	Salamander Scale (large pouch)	65 gp	18 lb.	Cinder Shield		65	18	1		Salamander scales stay supernaturally warm even after removal from their body. It is not uncommon for wealthy merchants to have winter beds lined with these scales to keep them comfortable in the colder months. As a fully grown adult, a salamander's scales are more than hard enough to use them for a protective shield.
satyr	Satyr	5	Satyr Hair (small pouch)	1 gp	3 lb.	Hair Tonic		1	3	1		A satyr's covering of thick lustrous fur is as much one of its trademarks as its horns. This hair is so thick in fact, that when brewed into a tonic, it can help regrow the hair of others.
satyr	Satyr	10	Satyr Horn	1 gp	6 lb.			1	6	2	 (x2)	As satyrs are known for inducing feelings of hedonism and excess, it is fitting that certain parts of their body carry the same properties even in death. When ground up and mixed into a paste, satyr horns have been known to carry a strong intoxicating and aphrodisiac effect. This has caused some naive satyrs to become the main event of an unscrupulous lord's party in a way they probably weren't expecting.
scarecrow	Scarecrow	5	Scarecrow Cloth	1 gp	3 lb.			1	3	1		The terrifying visage of the scarecrow, embodied in the sack cloth that constitutes its head. It remains as intimidating as it was when its host was still active, as its empty eyes still seem to see those around it. Use: When worn, you can may target one creature you can see within 30 feet of you as an action. If that target can also see you, it must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or be magically frightened until the end of your next turn. The frightened target is paralyzed. Once this ability has been used, this item loses all magic and becomes worthless.
scarecrow	Scarecrow	10	Evil Spirit	1 gp	1 lb.		spirit paper	1	1	1		The spirit of the evil creature that was used to animate the scarecrow remains around for a few moments even after its host body has been destroyed. With some spirit paper available, this spirit can be harvested and resold to less scrupulous mages. Requires spirit paper.
shadow	Shadow	15	Shadow Wisp	2 gp	1 lb.		spirit paper	2	1	1		Shadows barely have a corporeal form, and any that could be considered such is quickly dispersed once their animating force has been defeated. Some of it can be trapped inside a sheet of spirit paper, however, to be used to vex the unwary. Requires spirit paper. Use: If this item is left in the shadow of an incapacitated creature for at least 10 minutes, that creature's Strength score is reduced by 1d4. The target dies if this reduces its Strength to 0. This effect lasts until the spell lesser restoration or similar magic is used to remove this effect. If a non-evil humanoid dies while suffering from this effect, a new shadow rises from the corpse 1d4 hours later. Once this item has been used once, it loses all magical properties.
shambling-mound	Shambling Mound	10	Shambling Mound Mulch (small pouch x2)	12 gp	5 lb.	Potion of Superior Healing (DMG)		12	5	1		The decaying biomass that would have once fed the shambling mound is forever changed by its exposure to the powerful plant creature. It is a fantastic fertiliser and herbal remedy causing it to be coveted by both gardeners and healers.
shambling-mound	Shambling Mound	15	Shambling Mound Vine	15 gp	11 lb.	Vine Tunic		15	11	4	 (x4)	The lightning that created the shambling mound also causes it to have a resistance to that element. As the shambling mound adds more biomass to its body, it spreads this property to them as well. Intact samples of these can be taken and crafted into a truly unique set of vestments that can boast the same lightning absorbing abilities.
shambling-mound	Shambling Mound	20	Root-stem	110 gp	8 lb.	Wand of the Undergrowth		110	8	1		The root-stem of the shambling mound is actually the entirety of its being in the same way that a humanoid's brain is the entirety of theirs. It is prized in medicine for its regenerative properties and at the same time prized in necromantic schools for its decaying and consuming properties. 
shield-guardian	Shield Guardian	15	Shield Guardian Breastplate	50 gp	15 lb.	Armour of the Guardian		50	15	1		The breastplate of a shield guardian forms the structural basis for the rest of its form. Even if it is removed and refashioned, it can still communicate with the amulet of the original shield guardian, thus making it prime material for certain pieces of equipment.
shield-guardian	Shield Guardian	20	Spell Storing Plate	200 gp	5 lb.	Ring of Spell Storing (DMG)		200	5	1		The same magical framework that allows a shield guardian to store a spell is the same as that used in the famous ring of spell storing. If this plate is harvested properly, it can be refashioned into its much stronger counterpart.
skeleton	Skeleton	5	Bone Dust (small pouch)	8 cp	3 lb.			0.08	3	1		A skeleton touched by foul necromancy is forever changed in ways that transcend the physical. Dust from the bones of a raised skeleton continues to carry foul necromantic energies that can be recycled into other necromantic purposes and rituals. After all, necromancers are not known to waste anything.
minotaur-skeleton	Minotaur Skeleton	5	Bone Dust (small pouch)	8 cp	3 lb.			0.08	3	1		A skeleton touched by foul necromancy is forever changed in ways that transcend the physical. Dust from the bones of a raised skeleton continues to carry foul necromantic energies that can be recycled into other necromantic purposes and rituals. After all, necromancers are not known to waste anything.
minotaur-skeleton	Minotaur Skeleton	15	Minotaur Horn	10 gp	20 lb.	Helm of the Minotaur		10	20	2	 (x2)	The wicked horns of the minotaur have ended more than one hapless adventurer's life. When mounted on a sturdy helm, and with slight magical reinforcement, a wearer can emulate the deadly charge of the horns' original owner.
warhorse-skeleton	Warhorse Skeleton	5	Bone Dust (small pouch)	8 cp	3 lb.			0.08	3	1		A skeleton touched by foul necromancy is forever changed in ways that transcend the physical. Dust from the bones of a raised skeleton continues to carry foul necromantic energies that can be recycled into other necromantic purposes and rituals. After all, necromancers are not known to waste anything.
warhorse-skeleton	Warhorse Skeleton	10	Warhorse Skull	1 gp	30 lb.			1	30	1		A horse touched by necromantic energy is an iconic mainstay of any battle against a necromancer. The skulls of their tainted skeletons still carry some magical energy and can be used to change the appearance of a summoned steed. Use: If you are holding the warhorse skull when you cast either the find steed or find greater steed spells, you may choose to have the resulting summoned mount appear skeletal in nature. This does not affect the summoned mount's abilities or statistics in any way.
slaad-tadpole	Slaad Tadpole	5	Slaad Slime	3 sp	1 lb.		vial	0.3	1	1	 (vial)	The slime that coats a slaad smells like the bottom of a fetid swamp and looks like it too. It is believed that this slime has an innocuation effect against the diseases and parasitic eggs of the slaads, but this is mostly just conjecture. Otherwise, it is a mere curiosity for eccentric researchers.
red-slaad	Red Slaad	5	Slaad Slime	3 sp	1 lb.		vial	0.3	1	1	 (vial)	The slime that coats a slaad smells like the bottom of a fetid swamp and looks like it too. It is believed that this slime has an innocuation effect against the diseases and parasitic eggs of the slaads, but this is mostly just conjecture. Otherwise, it is a mere curiosity for eccentric researchers.
red-slaad	Red Slaad	10	Slaad Heart	30 gp	5 lb.			30	5	1		Slaadi are creatures of pure chaos, born from the unstable energies in Limbo. As such, their very bodies disrupt the natural order of things and those that consume some of their flesh tend to find that probability itself changes for them, if only temporarily. Beware however, as the universe is not to be trifled with, and it tends to find ways to balance itself out later. Use: As an action you may eat this item. If you do so, then once within the next 10 minutes you may choose to bend the laws of fate within your favour. If you do so, you gain advantage on one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw. If you choose not to, this item is wasted. After those 10 minutes have passed, your DM may choose at any time within the next 24 hours to impose disadvantage on 1 attack roll, ability check, or saving throw you make.
red-slaad	Red Slaad	15	Slaad Egg Gland	60 gp	1 lb.	Chest Burster		60	1	1		Underneath the claws of the red slaad lies a marble sized pouch that houses hundreds of miniscule slaad eggs. It is difficult to harvest this gland without crushing the eggs (or accidentally injecting yourself), but successfully doing so will yield a truly wicked potion ingredient that should only be reserved for one's worst enemies.
blue-slaad	Blue Slaad	5	Slaad Slime	3 sp	1 lb.		vial	0.3	1	1	 (vial)	The slime that coats a slaad smells like the bottom of a fetid swamp and looks like it too. It is believed that this slime has an innocuation effect against the diseases and parasitic eggs of the slaads, but this is mostly just conjecture. Otherwise, it is a mere curiosity for eccentric researchers.
blue-slaad	Blue Slaad	10	Slaad Heart	30 gp	5 lb.			30	5	1		Slaadi are creatures of pure chaos, born from the unstable energies in Limbo. As such, their very bodies disrupt the natural order of things and those that consume some of their flesh tend to find that probability itself changes for them, if only temporarily. Beware however, as the universe is not to be trifled with, and it tends to find ways to balance itself out later. Use: As an action you may eat this item.

blue-slaad	Blue Slaad	15	Blue Slaad Claw	100 gp	15 lb.	Sickle of Chaos		100	15	2	 (x2)	"The hooked claws of a blue slaad contain wicked hooks that dig into flesh and act as vectors for the transmission of the dreaded ""chaos phage."" This disease does not live long after the death of its slaad host, however that does not still mean that it cannot be used in nefarious artificing to create a weapon of even deadlier design."
green-slaad	Green Slaad	5	Slaad Slime	3 sp	1 lb.		vial	0.3	1	1	 (vial)	The slime that coats a slaad smells like the bottom of a fetid swamp and looks like it too. It is believed that this slime has an innocuation effect against the diseases and parasitic eggs of the slaads, but this is mostly just conjecture. Otherwise, it is a mere curiosity for eccentric researchers.
green-slaad	Green Slaad	10	Slaad Heart	30 gp	5 lb.			30	5	1		Slaadi are creatures of pure chaos, born from the unstable energies in Limbo. As such, their very bodies disrupt the natural order of things and those that consume some of their flesh tend to find that probability itself changes for them, if only temporarily. Beware however, as the universe is not to be trifled with, and it tends to find ways to balance itself out later. Use: As an action you may eat this item. If you do so, then once within the next 10 minutes you may choose to bend the laws of fate within your favour. If you do so, you gain advantage on one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw. If you choose not to, this item is wasted. After those 10 minutes have passed, your DM may choose at any time within the next 24 hours to impose disadvantage on 1 attack roll, ability check, or saving throw you make.
green-slaad	Green Slaad	15	Green Slaad Claw	150 gp	12 lb.			150	12	1		Only one of a green slaad's claws have much value; the one it used to cast spells with before it became a slaad. This claw is suffused with both the magic of its old life as well as the chaotic energies of Limbo. As such, it grants its wielder incredible, if unreliable, power. Use: This claw may be used as an arcane focus. If you do so, when a creature you can see is forced to roll a saving throw due to a spell you cast, you may force that creature to roll at disadvantage. Once you do so, you must finish a long rest before you can use this feature again. Any time before you regain the use of this feature, the DM can have you roll on the Wild Magic Surge table in the Player's Handbook immediately after you cast a spell of 1st level or higher. You then regain the use of this ability.
gray-slaad	Gray Slaad	5	Slaad Slime	3 sp	1 lb.		vial	0.3	1	1	 (vial)	The slime that coats a slaad smells like the bottom of a fetid swamp and looks like it too. It is believed that this slime has an innocuation effect against the diseases and parasitic eggs of the slaads, but this is mostly just conjecture. Otherwise, it is a mere curiosity for eccentric researchers.
gray-slaad	Gray Slaad	10	Slaad Heart	30 gp	5 lb.			30	5	1		Slaadi are creatures of pure chaos, born from the unstable energies in Limbo. As such, their very bodies disrupt the natural order of things and those that consume some of their flesh tend to find that probability itself changes for them, if only temporarily. Beware however, as the universe is not to be trifled with, and it tends to find ways to balance itself out later. Use: As an action you may eat this item. If you do so, then once within the next 10 minutes you may choose to bend the laws of fate within your favour. If you do so, you gain advantage on one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw.

After those 10 minutes have passed, your DM may choose at any time within the next 24 hours to impose disadvantage on 1 attack roll, ability check, or saving throw you make.
gray-slaad	Gray Slaad	20	Slaad Hide	300 gp	20 lb.	Slaad Doublet		300	20	1		The hide of a slaad is extraordinarily tough, and even more so once it has evolved into either its gray or death slaad variants. As befitting of a slaad's possessive and transformative nature, even the skinned hide of a mature slaad will attempt to mutate and change its wearer. It is only with advanced techniques that this property is curtailed and used only to the benefit of its new owner.
death-slaad	Death Slaad	5	Slaad Slime	3 sp	1 lb.		vial	0.3	1	1	 (vial)	The slime that coats a slaad smells like the bottom of a fetid swamp and looks like it too. It is believed that this slime has an innocuation effect against the diseases and parasitic eggs of the slaads, but this is mostly just conjecture. Otherwise, it is a mere curiosity for eccentric researchers.
death-slaad	Death Slaad	10	Slaad Heart	30 gp	5 lb.			30	5	1		Slaadi are creatures of pure chaos, born from the unstable energies in Limbo. As such, their very bodies disrupt the natural order of things and those that consume some of their flesh tend to find that probability itself changes for them, if only temporarily. Beware however, as the universe is not to be trifled with, and it tends to find ways to balance itself out later. Use: As an action you may eat this item. If you do so, then once within the next 10 minutes you may choose to bend the laws of fate within your favour. If you do so, you gain advantage on one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw. If you choose not to, this item is wasted. After those 10 minutes have passed, your DM may choose at any time within the next 24 hours to impose disadvantage on 1 attack roll, ability check, or saving throw you make.
death-slaad	Death Slaad	20	Slaad Hide	300 gp	20 lb.	Slaad Doublet		300	20	1		The hide of a slaad is extraordinarily tough, and even moreso once it has evolved into either its gray or death slaad variants. As befitting of a slaad's possessive and transformative nature, even the skinned hide of a mature slaad will attempt to mutate and change its wearer. It is only with advanced techniques that this property is curtailed and used only to the benefit of its new owner.
specter	Specter	15	Specter Remnant (regular specters only)	4 gp	1 lb.		spirit paper	4	1	1		A specter is a being of pure spite and malice, a soul severed from the cycle of death and afterlife. When their form is dispersed, fragments of their soul can be imprinted on spirit paper. These fragments radiate with as much hate as their original complete form, and prolonged exposure to it can result in terrible psychological damage. Requires spirit paper. Use: A creature that spends at least 6 hours a day within 30 feet of this item for 7 continuous days becomes cursed. While cursed in this way, the creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight while in sunlight. In addition, their dreams become wracked with nightmares and they gain no benefit from a long rest. If the cursed target sleeps within 30 feet of this item, they must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or have their hit point maximum reduced by 3d6 points. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. Only one creature may be cursed by this item at a time, and if a creature cursed by this item manages to remove their curse by any means, this item becomes useless and crumbles into dust.
specter	Specter	20	Poltergeist Paper (Poltergeist variant only)	12 gp	1 lb.		spirit paper	12	1	1		The confused energy of a poltergeist manifests itself in psychic outbursts capable of throwing full grown men and full sets of furniture across rooms. Upon a poltergeist's dispersal, a sheet of spirit paper can capture some of this errant energy to be used later for one's own mayhem and mischief. Requires spirit paper. Use: As an action, this paper may be attached to a target Medium or smaller creature or a target unattended object that weighs less than or equal to 150 pounds. Upon speaking a chosen command word or after a designated amount of time, the creature or object that this paper is attached to is hurled 30 feet in the direction away from the paper. If the paper is attached to a creature, they may roll a DC 13 Strength saving throw to avoid this forced movement. If the hurled target comes into contact with a hard surface or heavy object, the target takes 1d6 damage per 10 feet moved. This item may be used up to 3 times before it runs out of energy and become useless.
androsphinx	Androsphinx	10	Sphinx Tail	300 gp	12 lb.			300	12	1		The long leonine tail of a sphinx is incredibly distinctive and carries a great amount of cultural significance in some circles. Some sects and cults have a ritual of encasing the tail in dark wax and burning it as a candle wick. It is said that the visions they see in these seances reveal long forgotten secrets buried by time. Others say that sphinx fur just has a mild hallucigenic effect. Unfortunately, there is a distinct dearth of samples to test these hypotheses.
androsphinx	Androsphinx	15	Sphinx Heart	1,300 gp	12 lb.	Amulet of Secrets		1300	12	1		The heart of a sphinx is quite literally full with secrets and mystery. Skilled artificers can bring out this magic in the form of an amulet to aid those who have managed to defeat the sphinx.
androsphinx	Androsphinx	20	Sphinx Pelt	3,000 gp	40 lb.	Cloak of Distorted Time		3000	40	1		The sphinx pelt is both regal and mysterious. Those who wear it share in the noble countenance of the creature they have felled, as well as their independence from time and space.
androsphinx	Androsphinx	25	Sphinx Wing	3,000 gp	35 lb.	Wings of the Guardian		3000	35	2	 (x2)	The majestic wings of a sphinx rival that of celestial angels themselves. Like many magical wings, they make prime base materials for a set of artificial wings that grant the power of flight. These ones however have the added bonus of their sphinx owner's abilities of teleportation.
androsphinx	Androsphinx	30	Androsphinx Vocal Cords	15,000 gp	4 lb.	Horn of the Ancient Roar		15000	4	1		While the androsphinx has access to powerful spells, truly its most feared ability is its roar. A sonic blast imbued with the blessings of the gods themselves, the roar of a sphinx can wreak havoc on a mortal's body. The most learned of artificers have discovered the secret to transforming their powerful vocal cords into instruments to produce the same power. Some believe that the sphinxes themselves imparted this knowledge; why they would do so is a mystery.
gynosphinx	Gynosphinx	10	Sphinx Tail	300 gp	12 lb.			300	12	1		The long leonine tail of a sphinx is incredibly distinctive and carries a great amount of cultural significance in some circles. Some sects and cults have a ritual of encasing the tail in dark wax and burning it as a candle wick.

gynosphinx	Gynosphinx	20	Sphinx Pelt	3,000 gp	40 lb.	Cloak of Distorted Time		3000	40	1		The sphinx pelt is both regal and mysterious. Those who wear it share in the noble countenance of the creature they have felled, as well as their independence from time and space.
gynosphinx	Gynosphinx	25	Gynosphinx Eye	1,000 gp	3 lb.	Lenses of Secrets		1000	3	2	 (x2)	The eyes of the gynosphinx are bewitching, and even in death they seem to gaze back and burrow deep into your thoughts and secrets. 
gynosphinx	Gynosphinx	25	Sphinx Wing	3,000 gp	35 lb.	Wings of the Guardian		3000	35	2	 (x2)	The majestic wings of a sphinx rival that of celestial angels themselves. Like many magical wings, they make prime base materials for a set of artificial wings that grant the power of flight. These ones however have the added bonus of their sphinx owner's abilities of teleportation.
sprite	Sprite	10	Sprite Dust (small pouch)	1 gp	1 lb.			1	1	1		The ground up wings of a sprite produce a dust that is capable of replicating the sprite's notable ability to read the hearts of those they touch. Of course, if you've ground up a dead sprite's wings, no one would need magical dust to read your heart. Use: If sprinkled over a creature, that creature gains the ability to magically know the emotional state of the next target creature they touch. If the target fails a DC 10 Charisma saving throw, the user of the dust also knows the touched creature's alignment. Celestials, fiends, and undead automatically fail the saving throw. 
sprite	Sprite	15	Sprite Wing	1 gp	1 lb.	Dust of Disappearance (DMG)		1	1	2	 (x2)	"Sprites are notorious for being hard to catch. Part of this is their small size and agility, but mostly it is due to their ability to turn invisible whenever they wish. This magic is housed in their wings, giving rise to a saying popular in forested cultures: ""as obvious as a wingless sprite."""
stirge	Stirge	5	Stirge Needle	8 cp	1 lb.			0.08	1	1		As annoying as they are, the stirge needle is still an example of the perfect utility that only nature can achieve. Stirge needles are a mainstay of healer's cabins everywhere and in an ironic way, stirges may be responsible for saving more lives than they take.
stirge	Stirge	10	Stirge Bile	2 sp	1 lb.	Anti-venom (DMG)	vial	0.2	1	1	 (vial)	The digestive tract of a stirge is perfectly adapted to the drinking of blood and in fact possesses many enzymes that treat and purify blood for drinking. These enzymes have been used for decades in natural medicines to treat various poisons and maladies.
succubus-incubus	Succubus/Incubus	5	Succubus/ Incubus Blood	3 gp	1 lb.	Philter of Love (DMG)	vial	3	1	3	 (3 vials)	It is said that just a whiff of this blood can bring even the most chaste paladin to the most depraved acts. Indeed, the wild orgies these fiends hold often cause them to spill their own blood inadvertantly anyway, heightening the passions of all involved.
succubus-incubus	Succubus/Incubus	10	Succubus/ Incubus Eye	7 gp	1 lb.	Eyes of Charming (DMG)		7	1	2	 (x2)	The ever hypnotising eyes of these lusty fiends can continue to entice any that gaze upon them even after their removal.
succubus-incubus	Succubus/Incubus	15	Succubus/ Incubus Tail	40 gp	8 lb.	Chain of Command		40	8	1		The forked tail of these tempting fiends can often be found wrapped around their next victim, playing with them sensually and bringing them ever closer to their fall. When made into a whip, they are just as full of power and temptation as their previous owners.
tarrasque	Tarrasque	N/A	Tarrasque Heart	Varies	1,000 lb.			Varies	1000	1		The dusty temple walls of some forgotten societies often depict what some believe to be a tarrasque heart. The heart seems to be placed in a position of reverence, the shadow of a tarrasque acting as a guardian for the city. Use: Activating a tarrasque heart requires the work of 10 spellcasters who have access to at least one 6th level spell slot or higher. Each spellcaster must spend 10 hours in constant contact and focus on the tarrasque heart. At the end of the 10 hours, they each expend a 6th level spell slot or higher. This process must be repeated for 30 consecutive days, after which, the heart will activate and create a protective enchantment in a dome centered on itself and with a radius of 3 miles. While they are alive and inside the protective enchantment, the spellcasters that activated the heart may choose to spend an action to target any number of creatures inside the protective enchantment and force them to succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened, with the entire area under the protective enchantment considered the source of the effect. While frightened in this way, a creature drops anything they are carrying and must use their full movement as well as any potential dash actions to run as far away from the protective enchantment as possible. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if they are within the protective enchantment. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to this effect for the next 24 hours. If any of the 10 spellcasters die after activating the heart, the heart de-activates and the activation process must start again.
tarrasque	Tarrasque	N/A	Tarrasque Shell	Varies	100,000 lb.	The Titan Ship		Varies	100000	1		A tarrasque shell is the hardest substance known to man, harder than even the legendary mithral and adamantine. As such, it is virtually impossible to chip off any shards to be used as personal shields or armour, and may only be used in its entirety. Modern scholars believe that the fabled elven ship, 'Skellbladnir' was actually crafted from the shell of a tarrasque, explaining many of its purported magical properties.
tarrasque	Tarrasque	N/A	Tarrasque Horn	Varies	1,000 lb.			Varies	1000	1		A tarrasque horn is said to make a battering ram powerful enough to breach the gates of Hades itself and free all evil that dwell within. While that remains to be tested, it is certainly strong enough to break down any structure made by mortals. Even today, horn fragments are always found in the same kind of place: the destroyed gates of an abandoned city. Use: The tarrasque horn may be used as a ram (Dungeon Master's Guide, Page 255). This ram has a +14 to hit and deals 55 (10d10) bludegoning damage and deals double damage against objects and structures.
tarrasque	Tarrasque	N/A	Tarrasque Eye	Varies	30 lb.			Varies	30	2	 (x2)	The eyes of a tarrasque have witnessed countless civilisations lost to the annals of history (usually because they were destroyed by the tarrasque). That said, even though the tarrasque probably could not understand the majesty of what it was seeing, it still bore witness to them, and combined with its powerful inherent magic, that is enough for diviners to draw out the most ancient of secrets. Use: A creature casting the spell legend lore may instead choose to use the tarrasque eye instead of the spell's usual components. This does not consume the eye.
tarrasque	Tarrasque	N/A	Tarrasque Blood (x1,000 gallons)	Varies	9 lb.	Any other potion		Varies	9	1		Tarrasque blood flows in the deepest crimson, and every ounce of it is steeped in magical energy. Tarrasque blood is regarded as a universal catalyst, capable of being used as the base of almost any potion imaginable. It is said that spell circles drawn with a tarrasque's blood are capable of casting rituals powerful enough to challenge the gods themselves. Use: Tarrasque blood may be used to craft any other potion. Doing so requires 1 gallon of blood in place of the usual base component. No extra payment is required to craft the desired potion.
tarrasque	Tarrasque	N/A	Tarrasque Flesh	Varies	10,000 lb.			Varies	10000	1		Uncovered histories of destroyed civilisations speak of an ancient tribal nation of berserkers that roamed the land, razing and pillaging every city they came across. If the pictographs are understood correctly, the source of their ferocity came from the flesh of a tarrasque that they consumed before every battle. Where they got the strength to take down a tarrasque in the first place is another mystery entirely. Use: If a creature consumes 1 pound of tarrasque flesh, they gain a Strength score of 30 for the next 24 hours. At the end of this period, that creature must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or suffer 4 points of exhaustion as their mortal body attempts to process the extreme power it just consumed.
thri-kreen	Thri-Kreen	10	Thri-kreen Poison	5 gp	1 lb.		vial	5	1	1	 (vial)	The mandibles of a thri-kreen possess a weak venom capable of knocking out weak prey. While usually used solely by thri-kreen for hunting, some of the more enterprising thri-kreen tribes have learned to trade with others by fermenting their venom into an intoxicating brew famous for its pleasant numbing effect. Use: Can be used to coat up to 5 pieces of slashing or piercing ammunition or one slashing or piercing weapon. Applying the poison takes 1 minute. For the next minute, any creature successfully hit must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target is also paralyzed while poisoned this way. The poisoned target can repeat the saving throw on each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
thri-kreen	Thri-Kreen	15	Thri-Kreen Brain (Psionic Thri-Kreen only)	5 gp	2 lb.			5	2	1		The mind of a thri-kreen is alien enough to most other humanoids, and the mind of one blessed with psionics is even more so. This brain may be tapped to unleash that stored mental energy for a short burst of time. Use: You may spend an action to eat this brain. If you do so, for the next hour, you gain the ability to cast the mage hand spell at will (the hand is invisible) as well as cast the blur spell twice. 
thri-kreen	Thri-Kreen	20	Thri-Kreen Carapace	6 gp	35 lb.	Camouflage Chitin		6	35	1		Tiny crystal formations inside the hard carapace of the thri-kreen allow it to change colour to camouflage with its surroundings. When travelling paths known for thri-kreen attacks, it is best to be on the lookout for their large eyes which are harder for them to hide than the rest of their body.
treant	Treant	10	Treant Sap	7 gp	1 lb.		vial	7	1	3	 (3 vials)	Treant sap flows through its body like blood and is rich with both nutrients and magical energy. When diluted in water, a single vial of this sap is enough to fertilise a whole farm for a year.
treant	Treant	15	Treant Bark	150 gp	20 lb.	(Wooden) Breastplate		150	20	1		The bark of a treant is harder than that of an ordinary tree, having been blessed with the power of the forest itself. This bark is hard enough to create an armour that many druids enjoy wearing into battle.
treant	Treant	20	Treant Root	400 gp	10 lb.	Staff of the Woodlands (DMG)		400	10	1		Every treant has one main root that serves as the equivalent of a heart in humanoids. The treant draws most of their nourishment from this root and thus it is also imbued with the greatest amount of magical power. These roots can be recrafted into powerful magical items, especially the renowned staff of the woodlands.
troglodyte	Troglodyte	15	Troglodyte Hide	8 sp	25 lb.			0.8	25	1		Troglodyte hides are capable of changing colours to match their surroundings, allowing them to create ambushes on those less wary. While the camouflage ability is impressive, it loses much of this capability once removed from the troglodyte, and the hide itself makes for a poor armour. As such, it is often used only as a camouflage blanket used to disguise things from only very far away. Alternatively, the hides have been ground down and made into an ink that matches the colour of the parchment it is written on, allowing for the creation of secret messages revealed only under certain lights.
troll	Troll	5	Troll Flesh (10 pounds)	1 gp	1 lb.			1	1	1		While the taste leaves much to be desired, troll flesh is indeed nutritious and can be a very sustainable source of sustenance. It is however not recommended to be used as a long-term food option, as repeated consumption can lead to strange effects in the eater. Use: A pound of troll flesh can be consumed to fulfill any food requirements you may have for an entire day. A pound of troll flesh that has not been exposed to fire or acid will regenerate a quarter pound of flesh every 24 hours. If you eat 3 pounds of troll flesh within a time frame of 7 days, you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or undergo a permanent mutation in which one of your body parts changes to look more troll-like (but with no added benefits). This mutation can only be reversed by the greater restoration spell or similar magic.
troll	Troll	10	Troll Blood	30	1 lb.	Potion of Healing (DMG)	vial	30	1	5	 (5 vials)	Famous for their regenerative ability, troll blood has widely been used as the basis for the ubiquitous healing potion. Indeed, troll blood is so potent that it can be diluted repeatedly and still deliver a healing effect. As such, it is usually used to mass produce the basic version of the healing potion.
troll	Troll	15	Troll Heart	83 gp	7 lb.	Troll Amulet		83	7	1		The troll heart is one of the few organs in a troll's body that is not pledged to their terrible deity: Vaprak the Destroyer. As such, a troll heart is one of the few pieces of a troll that will not form a new troll around itself over time, and yet, its constant infusion of troll blood gives it some measure of regenerative ability which can be infused into an amulet for an ordinary humanoid to take advantage of.
umber-hulk	Umber Hulk	5	Umber Hulk Guts	5 gp	10 lb.			5	10	1		"The guts of an umber hulk are a key ingredient in a dye often found in Underdark society known as ""umber dusk"". This smoky grey colour is usually used as a form of camouflage paint for Underdark denizens, but its captivating depth has gained some popularity on the surface as well."
umber-hulk	Umber Hulk	10	Umber Hulk Mandibles	11 gp	6 lb.	Sickle, +1 (DMG)		11	6	1		The razor sharp mandibles of an umber hulk have been the end of many Underdark adventurers. They have been repurposed for many things in Underdark societies, including farming, saws, fishing hooks, and of course, weapons.
umber-hulk	Umber Hulk	15	Umber Hulk Carapace	25 gp	70 lb.	Plate Armour, +1 (DMG)		25	70	1		Harder than steel, and yet flexible and breathable, an Umber Hulk's carapace makes for a useful armour. Underdark societies that lack access to fuel for smelting can often be found wearing plates of Umber Hulk carapace instead.
umber-hulk	Umber Hulk	20	Umber Hulk Eye	70 gp	3 lb.	Wand of Confusion		70	3	2	 (x2)	The notorious eyes of an Umber Hulk are filled with a bewitching magic that confuses even the most seasoned of adventurers.
unicorn	Unicorn	5	Unicorn Blood	10 gp	1 lb.	Potion of Vitality	vial	10	1	5	 (5 vials)	Unicorn blood shines like silver with a rainbow sheen. Filled with a regenerative magic, the blood of a unicorn is sought after by every alchemist as a key ingredient in many potions. Most will also have the tact to not ask where you got it.
unicorn	Unicorn	10	Unicorn Hoof	40 gp	17 lb.	Unicorn Glue		40	17	4	 (x4)	The hooves of a unicorn, responsible for the swiftness and grace exhibited by these noble creatures when they run. They also exhibit strong magical properties. Use: You may spend an action to focus on a unicorn hoof in your hand as well as a location you are familiar with up to a mile away. You then teleport yourself and up to three willing creatures you can see within 5 feet of you, along with any equipent they are wearing or carrying, to that location. If you took part in the killing of the unicorn these hooves came from, the deity that created that unicorn becomes aware of where you teleported to. Once a unicorn hoof has been used once, it loses its magic and becomes worthless.
unicorn	Unicorn	15	Unicorn Hair (large bag)	330 gp	3 lb.	Instrument of Harmony		330	3	1		Unicorn hair resembles spun gold and is just as valuable. Woodland elves living in the unicorn's domain often sport bows strung with strands of these hairs, their arrows flying with the speed of the forest's patron. Alternatively, instruments strung with these hairs create an exquisite sound unmatched by any made from more mundane materials.
unicorn	Unicorn	20	Unicorn Horn	1,000 gp	13 lb.	Wand of the War Mage, +2 (DMG) or Unicorn's Charge 		1000	13	1		The horn of a unicorn is one of the most sought after materials in all of artificing and spellcraft. Infinitely usable, these horns have been turned into everything from wands, to enchanted weapons, to just magical dust. If you took part in the death of the horn's original owner however, do exercise caution in who you show your spoils too, as unicorns have many (very powerful) allies. Use: The dust made from one unicorn horn can be used to act as the material component in any spell. There is enough dust to substitute for up to 500 gold pieces worth of any material component. You do not have to use all of the dust for the same spell.
vampire	Vampire	10	Vampire Blood	200 gp	1 lb.		vial	200	1	3	 (3 vials)	The necrotic blood of a vampire, as dark and thick as blood can possibly become. While it may be foul, it does present one of the last hopes to cure the vampirism of a loved one. It is unfortunate however that such little amounts may be drawn from a slain vampire; it could be seen perhaps as a final taunt from the undead fiends. Use: A vial of vampire blood that has had the bless spell cast on it at least once a day for 7 consecutive days becomes a vampire bane potion. If this potion is drunk by a vampire spawn that was transformed by the vampire this potion was made from, that vampire spawn is completely cured of vampirism, reverting to their original form and alignment instantly.
vampire	Vampire	15	Vampire Hair (large pouch)	1,400 gp	3 lb.	Cloak of the Bat (DMG)		1400	3	1		A little known but interesting fact is that vampire hair continues to grow even after the transition to their new state, and even grows faster than it did in life. This is why vampires are so commonly seen sporting long locks of unruly hair. As a sign of their undeath, this hair possesses some degree of necrotic magic which can be literally weaved into new items.
vampire	Vampire	20	Vampire Fang	2,200 gp	2 lb.	Sword of Life Stealing (DMG)		2200	2	2	 (x2)	The symbol of a vampire, the prolonged canines that they use to plunge into their victims and drain them of life. The same dark powers they had before can be taken and recrafted into a weapon.
vampire	Vampire	25	Vampire Heart	15,000 gp	2 lb.	Crown of Darkness		15000	2	1		Even if a stake was driven through this heart, it is still harvestable as a useful item. This organ appears to drip darkness as much as it does blood. Those that have held one of these befouled organs claim to have heard whispers from the slain vampire, tempting them with power in exchange for loyalty beyond their vanquishing.
vampire-spawn	Vampire Spawn	10	Vampire Spawn Fang	60 gp	2 lb.	Dagger of Life Stealing		60	2	2	 (x2)	The fang of a vampire spawn cannot transform a victim into a vampire the way a full vampire can. They do however still possess some necrotic energy which can be transferred to a weapon crafted from them.
vampire-spawn	Vampire Spawn	15	Vampire Spawn Heart	Varies	2 lb.			Varies	2	1		The heart of a vampire spawn is a pitiful thing. More often than not, it is the heart of an innocent creature corrupted by a force more powerful than itself. Although it may have turned to evil in its undeath, the heart can still do good by being used to combat its dark master. Use: A vampire spawn heart that has had the spell remove curse cast on it once a day for 7 consecutive days, resonates with an energy counter to the darkness that once pervaded it. In this condition, a vampire spawn heart will attempt to warn anyone holding it of the approach of its old master. It will begin to beat slowly if the original vampire is within 300 feet of the holder, and beat progressively faster as the original vampire draws near.
water-weird	Water Weird	10	Living Water	30 gp	1 lb.	Decanter of Endless Water	enchanted vial	30	1	1	 (vial)	A water weird that has dispersed into water upon death still carries some semblance of magic in it, if only for a few fleeting moments. If scooped up quickly and preserved properly, it can be used in various minor water magics. Requires enchanted vial.
water-weird	Water Weird	15	Mote of Water	100 gp	1 lb.	Elemental Gem (Emerald)	enchanted vial	100	1	1		When a water elemental's summoned form is dispersed, it leaves behind small balls of foam that continue to carry trace amounts of elemental energy. These need to be collected quickly in specialised containers to prevent further degredation. If collected properly, they can then be used to craft an elemental gem. Requires enchanted vial.
wight	Wight	10	Wight Blood	5 gp	1 lb.		vial	5	1	3	 (3 vials)	The blood of a wight is a black congealed mess, however it carries strong traces of necrotic energy. This energy reacts strangely with living creatures, granting them interesting abilities, but at a cost. Use: If you drink this vial of blood, for the next 24 hours you gain darkvision out to 60 ft., as well as the ability to see the life spark of all living things. This life spark appears as a white hot aura around a creature's body and is visible even through invisibility, and opaque cover no more than 2 feet thick. While able to see this spark, you have advantage on any Wisdom (Perception) checks made to find living creatures. However, if you are in sunlight, you also have disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight. Also, you must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or have your hit point maximum reduced by 1d6+2 until you finish a long rest. You die if this causes your hit point maximum to be reduced below 0 and then rise again 24 hours later as a wandering zombie unless your body is destroyed or you are restored to life.
wight	Wight	15	Wight Hand	30 gp	2 lb.	Hand of Undeath		30	2	1		The touch of a wight is known for its life-draining ability. Even after its soul has finally left it, a wight's body is permanently altered by the dark forces that reanimated it. All it takes is for another spark of necrotic energy to restore it to a usable state.
will-o-wisp	Will-O-Wisp	10	Mote of Necrotic Energy	10 gp	1 lb.		enchanted vial	10	1	1		A will-o'-wisp is a malevolent being comprised almost entirely of necrotic energy resembling a ball of light. Upon dispersal of their form, some of this energy can still be harvested and used for other necrotic purposes. Requires enchanted vial.Use: As an action, you may sprinkle this item over one creature within 5 feet of you that has 0 hit points and is still alive. The target must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or die. If they die, you regain 3d6 hit points.
wraith	Wraith	15	Wraith Energy	85 gp	1 lb.	Curse of Spite	spirit paper	85	1	1		Wraiths are incorporeal figures, and as such, require the use of spirit paper to effectively harvest. Luckily, wraith energy is a very potent source of necrotic power, and makes for a potent curse when used properly. Requires spirit paper.
wyvern	Wyvern	10	Wyvern Tail	25 gp	20 lb.			25	20	1		Wyvern tails, when properly harvested and cleaned, possess weaker forms of the creature's infamous poison. This tail is often kept inside barrels of fermenting alcohol to imbue it with an extraordinarily strong flavour and proof. The proof is so high in fact that it is joked that wyvern tails kill more people after being removed than while they're still attached. 
wyvern	Wyvern	15	Wyvern Wing	25 gp	50 lb.	Wings of Flying (DMG)		25	50	2	 (x2)	Like the wings of many magical creatures, the wings of a wyvern are capable of being removed and transformed into artificial wings for their new owners.
wyvern	Wyvern	20	Wyvern Poison	600 gp	1 lb.		vial	600	1	1	 (vial)	Perhaps the most ubiquitous of all poisons, no assassin's kit is complete without at least one jar of wyvern poison. Use: Can be used to coat up to 15 pieces of slashing or piercing ammunition or one slashing or piercing weapon. Applying the poison takes 1 minute. For the next 10 minutes, any creature successfully hit must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 7d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half that on a successful saving throw.
xorn	Xorn	10	Xorn Stomach	10 gp	50 lb.			10	50	1		As creatures able to digest metals and gems, a xorn's stomach is one of the hardiest organs in the multiverse. Their digestive tract is valued among jewellers and miners, who use them to clean off items they find in the tunnels.
xorn	Xorn	15	Xorn Tooth	8 gp	10 lb.	Stone Cleaver Weapon		8	10	4	 (x4)	The teeth of a xorn are capable of moving through rock and stone like a hot knife through butter. They are revered among miners and stonecutters alike for this ability and there is never enough supply to meet demand. Alternatively, a weapon made from these teeth can serve dual purposes when used by the spelunking adventurer.
xorn	Xorn	20	Xorn Eye	20 gp	15 lb.	Treasure Compass		20	15	3	 (x3)	A xorn's sensory organs are incredibly alien to regular humanoids and indeed, as xorn have a strange physiology that blends their eyes and noses together in some bizarre fashion. Either way, these organs are remarkably sensitive to the scent of precious metals and gems. The application of that knowledge should require no further explanation.
xorn	Xorn	25	Xorn Shell	60 gp	120 lb.	Stone Swim Armour		60	120	1		A xorn swims through rock the way a fish swims through water, thanks largely in part to its outer shell. It is very difficult to take this shell without cracking it, but if you can haul it back in one piece, it can make for a very useful suit of armour that will have you swimming laps through mountains.
yeti	Yeti	5	Yeti Tongue	10 gp	2 lb.			10	2	1		The howl of a yeti is renowned for either signalling, or even calling, avalanches and blizzards. Mountain clans long ago learned how to dry these tongues into reeds and place them in pipes that they believe whistle upon the approach of violent weather.
yeti	Yeti	10	Yeti Hide	25 gp	35 lb.	Boots of the Winterlands (DMG)		25	35	1		Yetis are capable of surviving in the darkest, coldest winters in part largely to their thick hides and coats. In the desperate struggle that are mountain peaks, these coats are worth more than their weight in gold, and any mountain chief would happily welcome a stranger into their hut when presented with a gift of yeti hide.
yeti	Yeti	15	Yeti Eye	30 gp	1 lb.	Potion of Winter's Rest		30	1	2	 (x2)	The literally cold stare of a yeti is a terrible final sight. It is a piercing blue that freezes one's very soul and leaves them colder than the mountain itself. The magic in these eyes can be brought out in a potion when mixed with hardy mountain roots and water melted from ancient icicles to make a brew that can preserve a creature in ice for an indefinite period of time.
yeti	Yeti	20	Yeti Claw	60 gp	10 lb.	Frostclaw Weapon		60	10	2	 (x2)	The remains of a yeti's victims are simple to identify, for it is easy to see the way the edges of their wounds have frozen solid at the touch of the yeti.
abominable-yeti	Abominable Yeti	5	Yeti Tongue	10 gp	2 lb.			10	2	1		The howl of a yeti is renowned for either signalling, or even calling, avalanches and blizzards. Mountain clans have long learned how to dry these tongues into reeds and place them in pipes that they believe whistle upon the approach of violent weather.
abominable-yeti	Abominable Yeti	10	Abominable Yeti Hide	40 gp	45 lb.	Boots of the Winterlands (DMG)		40	45	1		Yetis are capable of surviving in the darkest, coldest winters in part largely to their thick hides and coats. In the desperate struggle that are mountain peaks, these coats are worth more than their weight in gold, and any mountain chief would happily welcome a stranger into their hut when presented with a gift of yeti hide.
abominable-yeti	Abominable Yeti	15	Yeti Eye	50 gp	1 lb.	Potion of Winter's Rest		50	1	2	 (x2)	The literally cold stare of a yeti is a terrible final sight. It is a piercing blue that freezes one's very soul and leaves them colder than the mountain itself. The magic in these eyes can be brought out in a potion when mixed with hardy mountain roots and water melted from ancient icicles to make a brew that can preserve a creature in ice for an indefinite period of time.
abominable-yeti	Abominable Yeti	20	Abominable Yeti Claw	100 gp	14 lb.	Frostclaw Weapon, +1		100	14	2	 (x2)	The remains of a yeti's victims are simple to identify, for it is easy to see the way the edges of their wounds have frozen solid at the touch of the yeti.
abominable-yeti	Abominable Yeti	25	Yeti Lungs (Only harvestable if the Abombinable Yeti had access to its cold breath ability)	150 gp	9 lb.			150	9	1		It is more than just a superstition that the howl of a yeti brings a blizzard, as anyone who has faced an abominable yeti can attest to. These larger specimens breathe the cold itself, using it to weaken large groups of unwary mountaineers before moving in for the final kill. Use: You may spend an action to press these lungs and exhale a 30-foot cone of frigid air. Each creature in that area must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking 10d8 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Once this item has been used, it cannot be used again and becomes worthless.
yuan-ti-abomination	Yuan-Ti Abomination	10	Yuan-Ti Blood	2 gp	1 lb.	Potion of Poison Immunity	vial	2	1	5	 (5 vials)	The blood of a yuan-ti is strange in that it combines enzymes characteristic of both serpentine and humanoid physiology. This curious property allows unique opportunities in alchemy for the creation of the perfect antivenom for humanoids to consume.
yuan-ti-abomination	Yuan-Ti Abomination	15	Yuan-Ti Poison	120 gp	1 lb.		vial	120	1	1	 (vial)	"The venom of a yuan-ti combines elements of several of the most deadly snakes in nature. The poison has been described by survivors as ""like having one's blood transfigured into fire."" Use: Can be used to coat up to 10 pieces of slashing or piercing ammunition or one slashing or piercing weapon. Applying the poison takes 1 minute. For the next minute, any creature successfully hit must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 3d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half that on a successful saving throw."
yuan-ti-abomination	Yuan-Ti Abomination	20	Yuan-Ti Abomination Scales (large pouch)	600 gp	14 lb.	Serpent Shield		600	14	1		A yuan-ti abomination wears no armour yet can deflect swords and maces with the strength of its scales alone. A few choice scales can be pried off following the abomination's death in order to make a shield imbued with the power of the serpent gods.
yuan-ti-abomination	Yuan-Ti Abomination	25	Serpent Touched Heart	3,000 gp	15 lb.			3000	15	1		The heart of a yuan-ti abomination is one that has been specially blessed by the serpent gods the yuan-ti worship. Locked inside this heart is incredible divine power, but as befitting of the twisted worship the serpent gods demand, it can be passed on only through its consumption. Use: You may spend an action to eat this heart. When you do, you transform into a yuan-ti abomination, as described in the Monster Manual, for the next hour. Your alignment remains the same and you retain any proficiencies you may have had originally. You do not get access to the weapons described in the yuan-ti abomination's statblock. At the end of the hour, or if you are forced prematurely back into your true form, there is a 10 per cent chance that instead of transforming back to your original form, you transform into a form resembling that of a Type 1 yuan-ti malison with a humanoid body but with a snake head. This effect is permanent and is considered your new true form. This effect can only be reversed with the power of a wish spell.
yuan-ti-malison	Yuan-Ti Malison	10	Yuan-Ti Blood	2 gp	1 lb.	Potion of Poison Immunity	vial	2	1	3	 (3 vials)	The blood of a yuan-ti is strange in that it combines enzymes characteristic of both serpentine and humanoid physiology. This curious property allows unique opportunities in alchemy for the creation of the perfect antivenom for humanoids to consume.
yuan-ti-malison	Yuan-Ti Malison	15	Yuan-Ti Poison	120 gp	1 lb.		vial	120	1	1	 (vial)	"The venom of a yuan-ti combines elements of several of the most deadly snakes in nature. The poison has been described by survivors as ""like having one's blood transfigured into fire."" Use: Can be used to coat up to 10 pieces of slashing or piercing ammunition or one slashing or piercing weapon. Applying the poison takes 1 minute. For the next minute, any creature successfully hit must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, taking 2d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half that on a successful saving throw."
yuan-ti-pureblood	Yuan-Ti Pureblood	10	Yuan-Ti Blood	2 gp	1 lb.	Potion of Poison Immunity	vial	2	1	3	 (3 vials)	The blood of a yuan-ti is strange in that it combines enzymes characteristic of both serpentine and humanoid physiology. This curious property allows unique opportunities in alchemy for the creation of the perfect antivenom for humanoids to consume.
arcanaloth	Arcanaloth	5	Arcanaloth Ichor	100 gp	1 lb.		enchanted vial	100	1	1	 (vial)	The ichor of an arcanaloth is the most valuable of all yugoloth ichors, being steeped in the knowledge and magic of the original arcanaloth. Requires enchanted vial.Use: When combined with 50 gp worth of gem dust and special oils, this ichor becomes a special ink invested with powerful magic. When you begin writing with this ink, you subconcsiously write down a spell that was known to the arcanaloth. After 2 hours of writing with this ink, you may pick any wizard spell from the arcanaloth's known spell list that is of a level for which you have spell slots, and add it to your spellbook as if you had copied it in a traditional manner. 
arcanaloth	Arcanaloth	10	Arcanaloth Poison	300 gp	1 lb.		vial	300	1	1	 (vial)	Despite their learned and sophisticated nature, an arcanaloth is more than capable of killing a mortal in close combat as they are using their spells. This is partly in thanks to the poison glands they possess under their claws, which add a touch of death to their razor sharp strikes. Use: Can be used to coat up to 5 pieces of slashing or piercing ammunition or one slashing or piercing weapon. Applying the poison takes 1 minute. For the next minute, any creature successfully hit must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, taking 3d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half that on a successful saving throw.
arcanaloth	Arcanaloth	15	Arcanaloth Tail	500 gp	9 lb.			500	9	1		The tricky arcanaloth has a tendency to sneak into places it does not belong, aided by its inherent ability to shapeshift and turn invisible. Part of this magic is kept in their tail, which can be spotted twitching before they use any of their deceptive abilitites. Use: This tail has 3 charges. While holding this tail you may spend 1 charge to use the tail to cast the spell alter self or invisibility (self only). Once this tail loses all charges, it dissolves into a useless black ichor.
arcanaloth	Arcanaloth	20	Yugoloth Heart	750 gp	2 lb.	Gem of Teleportation		750	2	1		Despite their wide ranging forms, all yugoloths possess the same heart. It is the magic inherent in this heart that both ties them to their home plane of Gehenna and makes them materially unstable enough to teleport at a whim.
mezzoloth	Mezzoloth	5	Mezzoloth Ichor	50 gp	1 lb.		enchanted vial	50	1	1	 (vial)	The ichor of a mezzoloth appears even more foul and dark than that of other yugoloths (if that is even possible). Like many yugoloth ichors, this ichor can be mixed with precious gem dust and oils to make an ink that passes on powerful magics. Requires enchanted vial.Use: When combined with 50 gp worth of gem dust and special oils, this ichor becomes a special ink invested with powerful magic. If you are able to prepare a spell of at least 5th level, when you begin writing with this ink you subconcsiously write down the information regarding the spell cloudkill. You may do this for a total of 10 hours, after which you successfully copy the spell into your wizard spellbook as if you had copied it from a regular source.
mezzoloth	Mezzoloth	10	Mezzoloth Gas	60 gp	1 lb.		enchanted vial	60	1	1	 (vial)	The gas of a mezzoloth is extraordinarily toxic and is said to have been the inspiration to whichever wizard invented the spell cloudkill. It will remain potent so long as it is kept in an enchanted vial, however it will dissipate much faster than a sample that came fresh from a living mezzoloth. Requires enchanted vial.Use: As an action you may make a ranged weapon attack to throw this vial at a point within 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Once the vial is destroyed, the trapped gas expands rapidly to fill a 10 foot radius sphere. The gas acts like the spell cloudkill with the exception that it only lasts for 1 round and requires no creature's concentration to maintain it.
mezzoloth	Mezzoloth	15	Mezzoloth Chitin	85 gp	70 lb.	Mezzoloth Mail		85	70	1		The dark chitin of a mezzoloth is harder than many metals and lends a distinctively insect-like appearance to an adventurer bold enough to wear it.
mezzoloth	Mezzoloth	20	Yugoloth Heart	750 gp	2 lb.	Gem of Teleportation		750	2	1		Despite their wide ranging forms, all yugoloths possess the same heart. It is the magic inherent in this heart that both ties them to their home plane of Gehenna and makes them materially unstable enough to teleport at a whim.
nycaloth	Nycaloth	5	Nycaloth Ichor	70 gp	1 lb.		enchanted vial	70	1	1	 (vial)	Nycoloth ichor is thicker and stickier than other yugoloth ichor and has a vague green tinge to it. This is odd considering that the magic it lends itself to points towards a more slippery nature. Requires enchanted vial.Use: When combined with 50 gp worth of gem dust and special oils, this ichor becomes a special ink invested with powerful magic. If you are able to prepare a spell of at least 2nd level, when you begin writing with this ink you subconcsiously write down the information regarding the spell mirror image. You may do this for a total of 4 hours, after which you successfully copy the spell into your wizard spellbook as if you had copied it from a regular source.
nycaloth	Nycaloth	10	Nycaloth Claw	55 gp	25 lb.	Sword of Wounding (DMG)		55	25	2	 (x2)	The claw of a nycaloth actually has dozens of tiny hook-like forms growing on the insides. These hooks cause massive damage when the claws rend unprotected flesh, making wounds worse with each progressive attack. While it may be considered vicious, the same principle can be applied to other weapons to give them the same combative edge.
nycaloth	Nycaloth	15	Nycaloth Wing	230 gp	35 lb.	Infernal Wings		230	35	2	 (x2)	Like many fiends, the wings of a nycaloth can be used as a base component to make the ever useful infernal wings. Their high quality makes them particulalry useful as a material, meaning the artificer has to put relatively little effort (and money) into making them.
nycaloth	Nycaloth	20	Yugoloth Heart	750 gp	2 lb.	Gem of Teleportation		750	2	1		Despite their wide ranging forms, all yugoloths possess the same heart. It is the magic inherent in this heart that both ties them to their home plane of Gehenna and makes them materially unstable enough to teleport at a whim.
ultraloth	Ultraloth	5	Ultraloth Ichor	100 gp	1 lb.		enchanted vial	100	1	1	 (vial)	The ichor of an ultraloth is almost as valuable as that of the yugoloth, full of the inherent magic of the ultraloth. Requires enchanted vial.Use: When combined with 50 gp worth of gem dust and special oils, this ichor becomes a special ink invested with powerful magic. When you begin writing with this ink, you subconcsiously write down a spell that was known to the ultraloth. After 2 hours of writing with this ink, you may pick any wizard spell from the ultraloth's known spell list that is of a level for which you have spell slots, and add it to your spellbook as if you had copied it in a traditional manner.
ultraloth	Ultraloth	10	Mark of Gehenna	300 gp	2 lb.			300	2	1		Other than their general form, every ultraloth carries some mark on their person that brands them as a general above lesser yugoloths, an individual to be respected and feared. This brand is more than an ordinary mark and carries a degree of magic to it that affects the wills of lesser beings even if they themselves are unaware of it. Use: While carrying this mark on you, you may choose to gain advantage on any Charisma based ability check attempted on a creature within 30 feet of you that has a CR rating less than that of your character level. That creature does not need to be aware of the mark, but must be able to hear and understand you for this effect to work. Once used, this ability cannot be used again until the next dawn.
ultraloth	Ultraloth	15	Ultraloth Eye	425 gp	1 lb.	Helm of Hypnotism		425	1	2	 (x2)	The transfixing eyes of an ultraloth can stun creatures with lesser wills and hold them still as the ultraloth moves in for the kill. 
ultraloth	Ultraloth	20	Yugoloth Heart	750 gp	2 lb.	Gem of Teleportation		750	2	1		Despite their wide ranging forms, all yugoloths possess the same heart. It is the magic inherent in this heart that both ties them to their home plane of Gehenna and makes them materially unstable enough to teleport at a whim.
zombie	Zombie	5	Zombie Juice	3 cp	1 lb.		vial	0.03	1	1	 (vial)	An absolutley putrid collection of drippings and fluids from a reanimated corpse. While it smells awful, the necromantic magic in it allows it to act as a powerful preservation agent. Fittingly, necromancers use this very juice to keep their more valuable experiments fresh, often farming lesser zombies for more of this chemical.
